We are residents of the Sub-Lunar realm, which is governed by the rule of Fate and Free will. This is the natural order of things as we know it. Our survival in the sub-lunar realm is dictated by preparedness and necessity. Akin to Plotinus's allegory of the turtle walking among the dancers, we are part of the world and must play by its rules. We must prepare, become knowledgeable, care for the body, form a collective, and worship the Gods. It is through these simple measures that we ensure survival and make use of the blessings we were given.</p><p>Bad things are expected to happen, especially when we are focused more on the flesh than that of the spirit. For example, imagine coming home tomorrow to figure out the bank foreclosed on your home and all of your belongings were trashed. Surely, this would be an awful event, but, in the long run of things, it's simply a stepping-stone. If you are breathing and conscious, you can still turn it around. This is why we emphasize building strong communities and kin, so that we may pursue knowledge and wisdom without the woes of the body being uncared for.</p><p>To add, the Gods have also implemented a great number of spirits who administer justice to the wicked. Even if it seems that an evil person has not recieved the justice due, they shall eventually (either later or when they perish and find themselves before the judges of the dead). Jupiter Himself has struck down many, and Nemesis continues to claim more.</p><h3>What about people being born sick and deprived?</h3><p>Their situation is truly sad but still not done out of evil. The entire purpose of the Sub-lunar realm is that of perfection. We can attribute all ills and woes delivered to us at birth to be part of a greater, alchemical process that is aimed at shooting us forward (just as pulling back a bow increases its shooting potential). I have never met a great person who has not experienced a great sadness—and for good reason. Just as the potter gives little regard to the feelings and musings of the clay, so do the Gods in the process of helping us return to Them. Whether it be our fated birth and death, the heavens upon said birth, the result of a previous incarnation, or any other such thing, this is all for our own good. We cannot judge nor hold the Gods accountable for woes of the flesh, which are entirely irrelevant in the long run.</p><p>Is this to say the Gods do not help our bodies? Surely not! Asclepius and other Gods help us greatly with our physical existence. But if our prayers go unanswered, we can be assured that it is a fated process and we must learn from it. Preparedness helps, too, to ensure we do not die and to prolong our life to attain more wisdom.</p><p>The Gods have given us agriculture, kin, community, medicine, and a whole host of other tools for our disposal. Become educated in all of them, and enjoy a longer life.</p><h3>Do the Gods allow evil?</h3><p>The Gods create nothing malevolent. They are perfect beings who give only good things. A large portion of wisdom comes from the simple question “What is Good?”, and that is for you to discern. No amount of writings or sacred knowledge will benefit you until you take these words into your heart and truly begin to understand them.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>The Gods do not allow bad things to happen. Mankind is largely responsible for all of our woes. The “bad things” we identify are often part of a larger process in which the issue is a cog rather than an end. Become a master of your realm by educating yourself and giving back to your community. Prepare yourself always, and do not become the turtle who gets squashed because it didn't want to join in on the dance.</p><p>I hope this short lesson helped some of you.<br>In glory of the Gods,<br>T.</p></article>
