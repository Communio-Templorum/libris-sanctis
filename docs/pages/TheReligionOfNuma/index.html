Each of its five essays deals with a distinct period and is in a sense complete in itself; but the dramatic development inherent in the whole forbids their separation save as acts or chapters. Roman religion may not be prepossessing in appearance, but though it is at first sight incomparably less attractive than Greek religion, it is, if properly understood, fully as interesting, nay, even more so.</p><p>The careful student of the history of the Romans cannot doubt the psychological reality of their religion, no matter what his personal metaphysics may be. It is the author's hope that these essays may have a human interest because he has tried to emphasise this reality and to present the Romans as men of like passions to ourselves, in spite of all differences of time and race.</p><ol><li><a href="#!/TheReligionOfNuma/chapter1/">The Religion of Numa</a></li><li><a href="#!/TheReligionOfNuma/chapter2/">The Reorganisation of Servius</a></li><li><a href="#!/TheReligionOfNuma/chapter3/">The Coming of the Sibyl</a></li><li><a href="#!/TheReligionOfNuma/chapter4/">The Decline of Faith</a></li><li><a href="#!/TheReligionOfNuma/chapter5/">The Augustan Renaissance</a></li></ol><small>Â©<meta itemprop="copyrightYear" content="1906">131 <abbr title="ab America condita, since the founding of America">AAC</abbr> Macmillan and Co., Limited<br>in public domain</small></article>
