All these behind him, Glaucus, swimming on with his huge hands through those Tyrrhenian seas, drew near the hills so rich in magic herbs and halls of Circe, daughter of the Sun,—halls filled with men in guise of animals. After due salutations had been given—received by her as kindly—Glaucus said, “You as a goddess, certainly should have compassion upon me, a god; for you alone (if I am worthy of it) can relieve my passion. What the power of herbs can be, Titania, none knows more than I, for by their power I was myself transformed. To make the cause of my strange madness known, I have found Scylla on Italian shores, directly opposite Messenian walls. It shames me to recount my promises, entreaties, and caresses, and at last rejection of my suit. If you have known a power of incantation, I implore you now repeat that incantation here, with sacred lips—If herbs have greater power, use the tried power of herbs. But I would not request a cure—the healing of this wound. Much better than an end of pain, let her share, and feel with me my impassioned flame.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque Giganteis iniectam faucibus Aetnen<br>arvaque Cyclopum, quid rastra, quid usus aratri,<br>nescia nec quicquam iunctis debentia bubus<br>liquerat Euboicus tumidarum cultor aquarum,<br>liquerat et Zanclen adversaque moenia Regi<br>navifragumque fretum, gemino quod litore pressum<br>Ausoniae Siculaeque tenet confinia terrae.<br>inde manu magna Tyrrhena per aequora vectus<br>herbiferos adiit colles atque atria Glaucus<br>Sole satae Circes, variarum plena ferarum.<br>quam simul adspexit, dicta acceptaque salute,<br>'diva, dei miserere, precor! nam sola levare<br>tu potes hunc,' dixit 'videar modo dignus, amorem.<br>quanta sit herbarum, Titani, potentia, nulli<br>quam mihi cognitius, qui sum mutatus ab illis.<br>neve mei non nota tibi sit causa furoris:<br>litore in Italico, Messenia moenia contra,<br>Scylla mihi visa est. pudor est promissa precesque<br>blanditiasque meas contemptaque verba referre;<br>at tu, sive aliquid regni est in carmine, carmen<br>ore move sacro, sive expugnacior herba est,<br>utere temptatis operosae viribus herbae<br>nec medeare mihi sanesque haec vulnera mando,<br>fine nihil opus est: partem ferat illa caloris.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="25">But Circe was more quick than any other to burn with passion's flame. It may have been her nature or it may have been the work of Venus, angry at her tattling sire. “You might do better,” she replied, “to court one who is willing, one who wants your love, and feels a like desire. You did deserve to win her love, yes, to be wooed yourself. In fact you might be. If you give some hope, you have my word, you shall indeed be wooed. That you may have no doubt, and so retain all confidence in your attraction's power—behold! I am a goddess, and I am the daughter also, of the radiant Sun! And I who am so potent with my charms, and I who am so potent with my herbs, wish only to be yours. Despise her who despises you, and her who is attached to you repay with like attachment—so by one act offer each her just reward.” But Glaucus answered her attempt of love, “The trees will sooner grow in ocean waves, the sea-weed sooner grow on mountain tops, than I shall change my love for graceful! Scylla.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">at Circe (neque enim flammis habet aptius ulla<br>talibus ingenium, seu causa est huius in ipsa,<br>seu Venus indicio facit hoc offensa paterno,)<br>talia verba refert: 'melius sequerere volentem<br>optantemque eadem parilique cupidine captam.<br>dignus eras ultro (poteras certeque) rogari,<br>et, si spem dederis, mihi crede, rogaberis ultro.<br>neu dubites absitque tuae fiducia formae,<br>en ego, cum dea sim, nitidi cum filia Solis,<br>carmine cum tantum, tantum quoque gramine possim,<br>ut tua sim, voveo. spernentem sperne, sequenti<br>redde vices, unoque duas ulciscere facto.'<br>talia temptanti 'prius' inquit 'in aequore frondes'<br>Glaucus 'et in summis nascentur montibus algae,<br>Sospite quam Scylla nostri mutentur amores.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="40">The goddess in her jealous rage could not and would not injure him, whom she still loved, but turned her wrath upon the one preferred. She bruised immediately the many herbs most infamous for horrid juices, which, when bruised, she mingled with most artful care and incantations given by Hecate. Then, clothed in azure vestments, she passed through her troop of fawning savage animals, and issued from the center of her hall. Pacing from there to Rhegium, opposite the dangerous rocks of Zancle, she at once entered the tossed waves boiling up with tides: on these as if she walked on the firm shore, she set her feet and, hastening on dry shod, she skimmed along the surface of the deep. Not far away there was an inlet curved, round as a bent bow, which was often used by Scylla as a favorite retreat. There, she withdrew from heat of sea and sky when in the zenith blazed the unclouded sun and cast the shortest shadows on the ground. Circe infected it before that hour, polluting it with monster-breeding drugs. She sprinkled juices over it, distilled from an obnoxious root, and thrice times nine she muttered over it with magic lips, her most mysterious charm involved in words of strangest import and of dubious thought. Scylla came there and waded in waist deep, then saw her loins defiled with barking shapes. Believing they could be no part of her, she ran and tried to drive them back and feared the boisterous canine jaws. But what she fled she carried with her. And, feeling for her thighs, her legs, and feet, she found Cerberian jaws instead. She rises from a rage of dogs, and shaggy backs encircle her shortened loins. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">indignata dea est et laedere quatenus ipsum<br>non poterat (nec vellet amans), irascitur illi,<br>quae sibi praelata est; venerisque offensa repulsa,<br>protinus horrendis infamia pabula sucis<br>conterit et tritis Hecateia carmina miscet<br>caerulaque induitur velamina perque ferarum<br>agmen adulantum media procedit ab aula<br>oppositumque petens contra Zancleia saxa<br>Region ingreditur ferventes aestibus undas,<br>in quibus ut solida ponit vestigia terra<br>summaque decurrit pedibus super aequora siccis.<br>parvus erat gurges, curvos sinuatus in arcus,<br>grata quies Scyllae: quo se referebat ab aestu<br>et maris et caeli, medio cum plurimus orbe<br>sol erat et minimas a vertice fecerat umbras.<br>hunc dea praevitiat portentificisque venenis<br>inquinat; hic pressos latices radice nocenti<br>spargit et obscurum verborum ambage novorum<br>ter noviens carmen magico demurmurat ore.<br>Scylla venit mediaque tenus descenderat alvo,<br>cum sua foedari latrantibus inguina monstris<br>adspicit ac primo credens non corporis illas<br>esse sui partes, refugitque abigitque timetque<br>ora proterva canum, sed quos fugit, attrahit una<br>et corpus quaerens femorum crurumque pedumque<br>Cerbereos rictus pro partibus invenit illis:<br>statque canum rabie subiectaque terga ferarum<br>inguinibus truncis uteroque exstante coercet.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="68">The lover Glaucus wept. He fled the embrace of Circe and her hostile power of herbs and magic spells. But Scylla did not leave the place of her disaster; and, as soon as she had opportunity, for hate of Circe, she robbed Ulysses of his men. She would have wrecked the Trojan ships, if she had not been changed beforehand to a rock which to this day reveals a craggy rim. And even the rock awakes the sailors' dread. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Flevit amans Glaucus nimiumque hostiliter usae<br>viribus herbarum fugit conubia Circes;<br>Scylla loco mansit cumque est data copia, primum<br>in Circes odium sociis spoliavit Ulixem;<br>mox eadem Teucras fuerat mersura carinas,<br>ni prius in scopulum, qui nunc quoque saxeus exstat,<br>transformata foret: scopulum quoque navita vitat.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>The Cercopes Transformed to Apes</h4><ol><ruby value="75">After the Trojan ships, pushed by their oars, had safely passed by Scylla and the fierce Charybdis, and with care had then approached near the Ausonian shore, a roaring gale bore them far southward to the Libyan coast. And then Sidonian Dido, who was doomed not calmly to endure the loss of her loved Phrygian husband, graciously received Aeneas to her home and her regard: and on a pyre, erected with pretense of holy rites, she fell upon the sword. Deceived herself, she there deceived them all. Aeneas, fleeing the new walls built on that sandy shore, revisited the land of Eryx and Acestes, his true friend. There he performed a hallowed sacrifice and paid due honor to his father's tomb. And presently he loosened from that shore the ships which Iris, Juno's minister, had almost burned; and sailing, passed far off the kingdom of the son of Hippotas, in those hot regions smoking with the fumes of burning sulphur, and he left behind the rocky haunt of Achelous' daughters, the Sirens. Then, when his good ship had lost the pilot, he coasted near Inarime, near Prochyta, and near the barren hill which marks another island, Pithecusae, an island named from strange inhabitants. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hunc ubi Troianae remis avidamque Charybdin<br>evicere rates, cum iam prope litus adessent<br>Ausonium, Libycas vento referuntur ad oras.<br>excipit Aenean illic animoque domoque<br>non bene discidium Phrygii latura mariti<br>Sidonis; inque pyra sacri sub imagine facta<br>incubuit ferro deceptaque decipit omnes.<br>rursus harenosae fugiens nova moenia terrae<br>ad sedemque Erycis fidumque relatus Acesten<br>sacrificat tumulumque sui genitoris honorat.<br>quasque rates Iris Iunonia paene cremarat,<br>solvit et Hippotadae regnum terrasque calenti<br>sulphure fumantis Acheloiadumque relinquit<br>Sirenum scopulos, orbataque praeside pinus<br>Inarimen Prochytenque legit sterilique locatas<br>colle Pithecusas, habitantum nomine dictas.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="91">The father of the gods abhorred the frauds and perjuries of the Cercopians and for the crimes of that bad treacherous race, transformed its men to ugly animals, appearing unlike men, although like men. He had contracted and had bent their limbs, and flattened out their noses, bent back towards their foreheads; he had furrowed every face with wrinkles of old age, and made them live in that spot, after he had covered all their bodies with long yellow ugly hair. Besides all that, he took away from them the use of language and control of tongues, so long inclined to dreadful perjury; and left them always to complain of life and their ill conduct in harsh jabbering. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">quippe deum genitor, fraudem et periuria quondam<br>Cercopum exosus gentisque admissa dolosae,<br>in deforme viros animal mutavit, ut idem<br>dissimiles homini possent similesque videri,<br>membraque contraxit naresque a fronte resimas<br>contudit et rugis peraravit anilibus ora<br>totaque velatos flaventi corpora villo<br>misit in has sedes nec non prius abstulit usum<br>verborum et natae dira in periuria linguae;<br>posse queri tantum rauco stridore reliquit.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>The Sibyl Becomes Gray and Decrepit</h4><ol><ruby value="101">After Aeneas had passed by all those and seen to his right hand the distant walls guarding the city of Parthenope, he passed on his left hand a mound, grave of the tuneful son of Aeolus. Landing on Cumae's marshy shore, he reached a cavern, home of the long lived Sibylla, and prayed that she would give him at the lake, Avernus, access to his father's shade. She raised her countenance, from gazing on the ground, and with an inspiration given to her by influence of the god, she said, “Much you would have, O man of famous deeds, whose courage is attested by the sword, whose filial piety is proved by flame. But, Trojan, have no fear. I grant your wish, and with my guidance you shall look upon the latest kingdom of the world, shall see Elysian homes and your dear father's shade, for virtue there is everywhere a way.” She spoke, and pointed out to him a branch refulgent with bright gold, found in the woods of Juno of Avernus, and commanded him to pluck it from the stem. Aeneas did what she advised him. Then he saw the wealth of the dread Orcus, and he saw his own ancestors, and beheld the aged ghost of great Anchises. There he learned the laws of that deep region, and what dangers must be undergone by him in future wars. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Has ubi praeteriit et Parthenopeia dextra<br>moenia deseruit, laeva de parte canori<br>Aeolidae tumulum et, loca feta palustribus ulvis,<br>litora Cumarum vivacisque antra Sibyllae<br>intrat et, ut manes adeat per Averna paternos,<br>orat. at illa diu vultum tellure moratum<br>erexit tandemque deo furibunda recepto<br>'magna petis,' dixit, 'vir factis maxime, cuius<br>dextera per ferrum, pietas spectata per ignes.<br>pone tamen, Troiane, metum: potiere petitis<br>Elysiasque domos et regna novissima mundi<br>me duce cognosces simulacraque cara parentis.<br>invia virtuti nulla est via.' dixit et auro<br>fulgentem ramum silva Iunonis Avernae<br>monstravit iussitque suo divellere trunco.<br>paruit Aeneas et formidabilis Orci<br>vidit opes atavosque suos umbramque senilem<br>magnanimi Anchisae; didicit quoque iura locorum,<br>quaeque novis essent adeunda pericula bellis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="120">Retracing with his weary steps the path up to the light, he found relief from toil in converse with the sage Cumaean guide. While in thick dusk he trod the frightful way, “Whether you are a deity,” he said, “Or human and most favored by the gods, to me you always will appear divine. I will confess, too, my existence here is due to your kind aid, for by your will I visited the dark abodes of death, and I escaped the death which I beheld. For this great service, when I shall emerge into the sunlit air, I will erect for you a temple and will burn for you sweet incense kindled at the altar flame.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">inde ferens lassos averso tramite passus<br>cum duce Cumaea mollit sermone laborem.<br>dumque iter horrendum per opaca crepuscula carpit,<br>'seu dea tu praesens, seu dis gratissima,' dixit,<br>'numinis instar eris semper mihi, meque fatebor<br>muneris esse tui, quae me loca mortis adire,<br>quae loca me visae voluisti evadere mortis.<br>pro quibus aerias meritis evectus ad auras<br>templa tibi statuam, tribuam tibi turis honores.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="129">The prophetess looked on him and with sighs, “I am no goddess,” she replied, “nor is it well to honor any mortal head with tribute of the holy frankincense. And, that you may not err through ignorance, I tell you life eternal without end was;offered to me, if I would but yield virginity to Phoebus for his love. And, while he hoped for this and in desire offered to bribe me for my virtue, first with gifts, he said, ‘Maiden of Cumae choose whatever you may wish, and you shall gain all that you wish.’ I pointed to a heap of dust collected there, and foolishly replied, `As many birthdays must be given to me as there are particles of sand.' For I forgot to wish them days of changeless youth. He gave long life and offered youth besides, if I would grant his wish. This I refused, I live unwedded still. My happier time has fled away, now comes with tottering step infirm old age, which I shall long endure. You find me ending seven long centuries, and there remain for me, before my years equal the number of those grains of sand, three hundred harvests, three hundred vintages! The time will come, when long increase of days will so contract me from my present size and so far waste away my limbs with age that I shall dwindle to a trifling weight, so trifling, it will never be believed I once was loved and even pleased a god. Perhaps, even Phoebus will not recognize me, or will deny he ever bore me love. But, though I change till eye would never know me, my voice shall live, the fates will leave my voice.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">respicit hunc vates et suspiratibus haustis<br>'nec dea sum,' dixit 'nec sacri turis honore<br>humanum dignare caput, neu nescius erres,<br>lux aeterna mihi carituraque fine dabatur,<br>si mea virginitas Phoebo patuisset amanti.<br>dum tamen hanc sperat, dum praecorrumpere donis<br>me cupit, "elige," ait "virgo Cumaea, quid optes:<br>optatis potiere tuis." ego pulveris hausti<br>ostendens cumulum, quot haberet corpora pulvis,<br>tot mihi natales contingere vana rogavi;<br>excidit, ut peterem iuvenes quoque protinus annos.<br>hos tamen ille mihi dabat aeternamque iuventam,<br>si Venerem paterer: contempto munere Phoebi<br>innuba permaneo; sed iam felicior aetas<br>terga dedit, tremuloque gradu venit aegra senectus,<br>quae patienda diu est. nam iam mihi saecula septem<br>acta, tamen superest, numeros ut pulveris aequem,<br>ter centum messes, ter centum musta videre.<br>tempus erit, cum de tanto me corpore parvam<br>longa dies faciet, consumptaque membra senecta<br>ad minimum redigentur onus: nec amata videbor<br>nec placuisse deo, Phoebus quoque forsitan ipse<br>vel non cognoscet, vel dilexisse negabit:<br>usque adeo mutata ferar nullique videnda,<br>voce tamen noscar; vocem mihi fata relinquent.'</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Ulysses with Polyphemus and Circe</h4><ol><ruby value="154">Sibylla with such words beguild their way from Stygian realms up to the Euboean town. Trojan Aeneas, after he had made due sacrifice in Cumae, touched the shore that had not yet been given his nurse's name. There Macareus of Neritus had come, companion of long tried Ulysses, there he rested, weary of his lengthened toils. He recognized one left in Aetna's cave, greek Achaemenides, and, all amazed to find him yet alive, he said to him, “What chance, or what god, Achaemenides, preserves you? Why is this barbarian ship conveying you a Greek? What land is sought?” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia convexum per iter memorante Sibylla<br>sedibus Euboicam Stygiis emergit in urbem<br>Troius Aeneas sacrisque ex more litatis<br>litora adit nondum nutricis habentia nomen.<br>hic quoque substiterat post taedia longa laborum<br>Neritius Macareus, comes experientis Ulixis.<br>desertum quondam mediis qui rupibus Aetnae<br>noscit Achaemeniden inprovisoque repertum<br>vivere miratus, 'qui te casusve deusve<br>servat, Achaemenide? cur' inquit 'barbara Graium<br>prora vehit? petitur vestra quae terra carina?'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="165">No longer ragged in the clothes he wore and his own master, wearing clothes not tacked with sharp thorns, Achaemenides replied, “Again may I see Polyphemus' jaws out-streaming with their slaughtered human blood; if my own home and Ithaca give more delight to me than this barbarian bark, or if I venerate Aeneas less than my own father. If I should give my all, it never could express my gratitude, that I can speak and breath, and see the heavens illuminated by the gleaming sun—how can I be ungrateful and forget all this? Because of him these limbs of mine were spared the Cyclops' jaws; and, though I were even now to leave the light of life, I should at worst be buried in a tomb—not in his maw. What were my feelings when (unless indeed my terror had deprived me of all sense) left there, I saw you making for the open sea? I wished to shout aloud, but was afraid it would betray me to the enemy. The shoutings of Ulysses nearly caused destruction of your ship and there I saw the Cyclops, when he tore a crag away and hurled the huge rock in the whirling waves; I saw him also throw tremendous stones with his gigantic arms. They flew afar, as if impelled by catapults of war, I was struck dumb with terror lest the waves or stones might overwhelm the ship, forgetting that I still was on the shore! But when your flight had saved you from that death of cruelty, the Cyclops, roaring rage, paced all about Mount Aetna, groping through its forests with his outstretched arms. Deprived of sight, he stumbled there against the rocks, until he reached the sea; and stretching out his gore stained arms into its waters there, he cursed all of the Grecian race, and said, `Oh! that some accident would carry back Ulysses to me, or but one of his companions; against whom my rage might vent itself, whose joints my hand might tear whose blood might drench my throat, whose living limbs might quiver in my teeth. How trifling then, how insignificant would be the loss, of my sight which he took from me!' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">talia quaerenti, iam non hirsutus amictu,<br>iam suus et spinis conserto tegmine nullis,<br>fatur Achaemenides: 'iterum Polyphemon et illos<br>adspiciam fluidos humano sanguine rictus,<br>hac mihi si potior domus est Ithaceque carina,<br>si minus Aenean veneror genitore, nec umquam<br>esse satis potero, praestem licet omnia, gratus.<br>quod loquor et spiro caelumque et sidera solis<br>respicio, possimne ingratus et inmemor esse?<br>ille dedit, quod non anima haec Cyclopis in ora<br>venit, et ut iam nunc lumen vitale relinquam,<br>aut tumulo aut certe non illa condar in alvo.<br>quid mihi tunc animi (nisi si timor abstulit omnem<br>sensum animumque) fuit, cum vos petere alta relictus<br>aequora conspexi? volui inclamare, sed hosti<br>prodere me timui: vestrae quoque clamor Ulixis<br>paene rati nocuit. vidi, cum monte revulsum<br>inmanem scopulum medias permisit in undas;<br>vidi iterum veluti tormenti viribus acta<br>vasta Giganteo iaculantem saxa lacerto<br>et, ne deprimeret fluctus ventusve carinam,<br>pertimui, iam me non esse oblitus in illa.<br>ut vero fuga vos a certa morte reduxit,<br>ille quidem totam gemebundus obambulat Aetnam<br>praetemptatque manu silvas et luminis orbus<br>rupibus incursat foedataque bracchia tabo<br>in mare protendens gentem exsecratur Achivam<br>atque ait: "o si quis referat mihi casus Ulixem,<br>aut aliquem e sociis, in quem mea saeviat ira,<br>viscera cuius edam, cuius viventia dextra<br>membra mea laniem, cuius mihi sanguis inundet<br>guttur, et elisi trepident sub dentibus artus:<br>quam nullum aut leve sit damnum mihi lucis ademptae!"</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="198">“All this and more he said. A ghastly horror took possession of me when I saw his face and every feature streaming yet with blood, his ruthless hands, and the vile open space where his one eye had been, and his coarse limbs, and his beard matted through with human blood. It seemed as if Death were before my eyes, yet that was but the least part of my woe. I seemed upon the point of being caught, my flesh about to be the food of his. Before my mind was fixed the time I saw two bodies of my loved companions dashed three or four times hard against the ground, when he above them, like a lion, crouched, devouring quickly in his hideous jaws, their entrails and their flesh and their crushed bones, white marrowed, and their mangled quivering limbs. A trembling fear seized on me as I stood pallid and without power to move from there, while I recalled him chewing greedily, and belching out his bloody banquet from his huge mouth—vomiting crushed pieces mixed with phlegmy wine—and I feared such a doom in readiness, awaited wretched me. Most carefully concealed for many days, trembling at every sound and fearing death, although desiring death; I fed myself on grass and acorns, mixed with leaves; alone and destitute, despondent unto death, awaiting my destruction I lost hope. In that condition a long while, at last I saw a ship not far off, and by signs prayed for deliverance, as I ran in haste, down to the shore. My prayers prevailed on them. A Trojan ship took in and saved a Greek! And now, O dearest to me of all men, tell me of your adventures, of your chief and comrades, when you sailed out on the sea.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">haec et plura ferox, me luridus occupat horror<br>spectantem vultus etiamnum caede madentes<br>crudelesque manus et inanem luminis orbem<br>membraque et humano concretam sanguine barbam.<br>mors erat ante oculos, minimum tamen illa malorum,<br>et iam prensurum, iam nunc mea viscera rebar<br>in sua mersurum, mentique haerebat imago<br>temporis illius, quo vidi bina meorum<br>ter quater adfligi sociorum corpora terrae,<br>cum super ipse iacens hirsuti more leonis<br>visceraque et carnes cumque albis ossa medullis<br>semianimesque artus avidam condebat in alvum;<br>me tremor invasit: stabam sine sanguine maestus,<br>mandentemque videns eiectantemque cruentas<br>ore dapes et frusta mero glomerata vomentem:<br>talia fingebam misero mihi fata parari<br>perque dies multos latitans omnemque tremiscens<br>ad strepitum mortemque timens cupidusque moriri<br>glande famem pellens et mixta frondibus herba<br>solus inops exspes leto poenaeque relictus<br>hanc procul adspexi longo post tempore navem<br>oravique fugam gestu ad litusque cucurri,<br>et movi: Graiumque ratis Troiana recepit!<br>tu quoque pande tuos, comitum gratissime, casus<br>et ducis et turbae, quae tecum est credita ponto.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="223">Then Macareus told him of Aeolus, the son of Hippotas, whose kingdom is the Tuscan sea, whose prison holds the winds, and how Ulysses had received the winds tied in a bull's hide bag, an awesome gift, how nine days with a favoring breeze they sailed and saw afar their longed for native land. How, as the tenth day dawned, the crew was moved by envy and a lust for gold, which they imagined hidden in that leathern bag and so untied the thong which held the winds. These, rushing out, had driven the vessel back over the waves which they had safely passed, back to the harbor of King Aeolus. “From there,” he said, “we sailed until we reached the ancient city of Lamus, Laestrygon.—Antiphates was reigning in that land, and I was sent with two men of our troop, ambassadors to see him. Two of us escaped with difficulty, but the third stained the accursed Lestrygonian's jaws with his devoted blood. Antiphates pursued us, calling out his murderous horde. They came and, hurling stones and heavy beams, they overwhelmed and sank both ships and men. One ship escaped, on which Ulysses sailed. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeolon ille refert Tusco regnare profundo,<br>Aeolon Hippotaden, cohibentem carcere ventos;<br>quos bovis inclusos tergo, memorabile munus,<br>Dulichium sumpsisse ducem flatuque secundo<br>lucibus isse novem et terram aspexisse petitam;<br>proxima post nonam cum sese aurora moveret,<br>invidia socios praedaeque cupidine victos<br>esse; ratos aurum, dempsisse ligamina ventis;<br>cum quibus isse retro, per quas modo venerat undas,<br>Aeoliique ratem portus repetisse tyranni.<br>'inde Lami veterem Laestrygonis' inquit 'in urbem<br>venimus: Antiphates terra regnabat in illa.<br>missus ad hunc ego sum, numero comitante duorum,<br>vixque fuga quaesita salus comitique mihique,<br>tertius e nobis Laestrygonis inpia tinxit<br>ora cruore suo. fugientibus instat et agmen<br>concitat Antiphates; coeunt et saxa trabesque<br>coniciunt merguntque viros merguntque carinas.<br>una tamen, quae nos ipsumque vehebat Ulixem,</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="242">“Grieving, lamenting for companions lost, we finally arrived at that land which you may discern far off, and, trust my word, far off it should be seen—I saw it near! And oh most righteous Trojan, Venus' son, Aeneas, whom I call no more a foe, I warn you now: avoid the shores of Circe. We moored our ship beside that country too; but, mindful of the dangers we had run with Laestrygons and cruel Polyphemus, refused to go ashore. Ulysses chose some men by lot and told them to seek out a roof which he had seen among the trees. The lot took me, then staunch Polytes next, Eurylochus, Elpenor fond of wine, and eighteen more and brought us to the walls of Circe's dwelling. As we drew near and stood before the door, a thousand wolves rushed out from woods near by, and with the wolves there ran she bears and lionesses, dread to see. And yet we had no cause to fear, for none would harm us with the smallest scratch. Why, they in friendship even wagged their tails and fawned upon us, while we stood in doubt. Then handmaids took us in and led us on through marble halls to the presence of their queen. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">effugit. amissa sociorum parte dolentes<br>multaque conquesti terris adlabimur illis,<br>quas procul hinc cernis (procul est, mihi crede, videnda<br>insula visa mihi!) tuque o iustissime Troum,<br>nate dea, (neque enim finito Marte vocandus<br>hostis es, Aenea) moneo, fuge litora Circes!<br>nos quoque Circaeo religata in litore pinu,<br>Antiphatae memores inmansuetique Cyclopis,<br>ire negabamus; sed tecta ignota subire<br>sorte sumus lecti: sors me fidumque Politen<br>Eurylochumque simul nimiique Elpenora vini<br>bisque novem socios Circaea ad moenia misit.<br>quae simul attigimus stetimusque in limine tecti,<br>mille lupi mixtaeque lupis ursaeque leaeque<br>occursu fecere metum, sed nulla timenda<br>nullaque erat nostro factura in corpore vulnus;<br>quin etiam blandas movere per aera caudas<br>nostraque adulantes comitant vestigia, donec<br>excipiunt famulae perque atria marmore tecta</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="261">She, in a beautiful recess, sat on her throne, clad richly in a shining purple robe, and over it she wore a golden veil. Nereids and nymphs, who never carded fleece with motion of their fingers, nor drew out a ductile thread, were setting potent herbs in proper order and arranging them in baskets—a confusing wealth of flowers were scattered among leaves of every hue: and she prescribed the tasks they all performed. She knew the natural use of every leaf and combinations of their virtues, when mixed properly; and, giving them her close attention, she examined every herb as it was weighed. When she observed us there, and had received our greetings and returned them, she smiled, as if we should be well received. At once she had her maidens bring a drink of parched barley, of honey and strong wine, and curds of milk. And in the nectarous draught she added secretly her baleful drugs. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ad dominam ducunt: pulchro sedet illa recessu<br>sollemni solio pallamque induta nitentem<br>insuper aurato circumvelatur amictu.<br>Nereides nymphaeque simul, quae vellera motis<br>nulla trahunt digitis nec fila sequentia ducunt:<br>gramina disponunt sparsosque sine ordine flores<br>secernunt calathis variasque coloribus herbas;<br>ipsa, quod hae faciunt, opus exigit, ipsa, quis usus<br>quove sit in folio, quae sit concordia mixtis,<br>novit et advertens pensas examinat herbas.<br>haec ubi nos vidit, dicta acceptaque salute<br>diffudit vultus et reddidit omina votis.<br>nec mora, misceri tosti iubet hordea grani<br>mellaque vimque meri cum lacte coagula passo,<br>quique sub hac lateant furtim dulcedine, sucos</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="276">“We took the cups presented to us by her sacred right hand; and, as soon as we, so thirsty, quaffed them with our parching mouths, that ruthless goddess with her outstretched wand touched lightly the topmost hair upon our heads. (Although I am ashamed, I tell you this) stiff bristles quickly grew out over me, and I could speak no more. Instead of words I uttered hoarse murmurs and towards the ground began to bend and gaze with all my face. I felt my mouth take on a hardened skin with a long crooked snout, and my neck swell with muscles. With the very member which a moment earlier had received the cup I now made tracks in sand of the palace court. Then with my friends, who suffered a like change (charms have such power!) I was prisoned in a stye. We saw Eurylochus alone avoid our swinish form, for he refused the cup. If he had drained it, I should still remain one of a bristly herd. Nor would his news have made Ulysses sure of our disaster and brought a swift avenger of our fate. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">adicit. accipimus sacra data pocula dextra.<br>quae simul arenti sitientes hausimus ore,<br>et tetigit summos virga dea dira capillos,<br>(et pudet et referam) saetis horrescere coepi,<br>nec iam posse loqui, pro verbis edere raucum<br>murmur et in terram toto procumbere vultu,<br>osque meum sensi pando occallescere rostro,<br>colla tumere toris, et qua modo pocula parte<br>sumpta mihi fuerant, illa vestigia feci<br>cumque eadem passis (tantum medicamina possunt!)<br>claudor hara, solumque suis caruisse figura<br>vidimus Eurylochum: solus data pocula fugit;<br>quae nisi vitasset, pecoris pars una manerem<br>nunc quoque saetigeri, nec tantae cladis ab illo<br>certior ad Circen ultor venisset Ulixes.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="291">“Peace bearing Hermes gave him a white flower from a black root, called Moly by the gods. With this protection and the god's advice he entered Circe's hall and, as she gave the treacherous cup and with her magic wand essayed to touch his hair, he drove her back and terrified her with his quick drawn sword. She gave her promise, and, right hands exchanged, he was received unharmed into her couch, where he required the bodies of his friends awarded him, as his prized marriage gift. We then were sprinkled with more favored juice of harmless plants, and smitten on the head with the magic wand reversed. And new charms were repeated, all conversely to the charms which had degraded us. Then, as she sings, more and yet more we raise ourselves erect, the bristles fall off and the fissures leave our cloven feet, our shoulders overcome their lost shape and our arms become attached, as they had been before. With tears of joy we all embrace him, also weeping tears; and we cling fondly to our chieftain's neck; -- not one of us could say a single word till thus we had attested gratitude.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">pacifer huic dederat florem Cyllenius album:<br>moly vocant superi, nigra radice tenetur;<br>tutus eo monitisque simul caelestibus intrat<br>ille domum Circes et ad insidiosa vocatus<br>pocula conantem virga mulcere capillos<br>reppulit et stricto pavidam deterruit ense.<br>inde fides dextraeque datae thalamoque receptus<br>coniugii dotem sociorum corpora poscit.<br>spargimur ignotae sucis melioribus herbae<br>percutimurque caput conversae verbere virgae,<br>verbaque dicuntur dictis contraria verbis.<br>quo magis illa canit, magis hoc tellure levati<br>erigimur, saetaeque cadunt, bifidosque relinquit<br>rima pedes, redeunt umeri et subiecta lacertis<br>bracchia sunt: flentem flentes amplectimur ipsi<br>haeremusque ducis collo nec verba locuti<br>ulla priora sumus quam nos testantia gratos.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Picus and Canens</h4><ol><ruby value="308">“The full space of a year detained us there, and I, remaining that long stretch of time, saw many things and heard as much besides: and this among the many other things, was told me secretly by one of the four handmaidens of those rites. While Circe passed her time from all apart except my chief, she brought me to a white marble shape, a youth who bore a woodpecker upon his head. It stood erected in a hallowed place, adorned with many wreaths. When I had asked the statue's name and why he stood revered in that most sacred temple, and what caused that bird he carried on his head; she said:—`Listen, Macareus, and learn from this tale too the power of Circe, and weigh the knowledge well!’ <rtc lang="la" translate="no">annua nos illic tenuit mora, multaque praesens<br>tempore tam longo vidi, multa auribus hausi,<br>hoc quoque cum multis, quod clam mihi rettulit una<br>quattuor e famulis ad talia sacra paratis.<br>cum duce namque meo Circe dum sola moratur,<br>illa mihi niveo factum de marmore signum<br>ostendit iuvenale gerens in vertice picum,<br>aede sacra positum multisque insigne coronis.<br>quis foret et quare sacra coleretur in aede,<br>cur hanc ferret avem, quaerenti et scire volenti<br>"accipe" ait, "Macareu, dominaeque potentia quae sit<br>hinc quoque disce meae; tu dictis adice mentem!</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="320">“`Picus, offspring of Saturn, was the king of the Ausonian land, one very fond of horses raised for war. The young man's form was just what you now see, and had you known him as he lived, you would not change a line. His nature was as noble as his shape. He could not yet have seen the steeds contend four times in races held with each fifth year at Grecian Elis. But his good looks had charmed the dryads born on Latin hills, Naiads would pine for him—both goddesses of spring and goddesses of fountains, pined for him, and nymphs that live in streaming Albula, Numicus, Anio's course, brief flowing Almo, and rapid Nar and Farfarus, so cool in its delightful shades; all these and those which haunt the forest lake of Scythian Diana and the other nearby lakes. But, heedless of all these, he loved a nymph whom on the hill, called Palatine, 'tis said, Venilia bore to Janus double faced. When she had reached the age of marriage, she was given to Picus Laurentine, preferred by her above all others—wonderful indeed her beauty, but more wonderful her skill in singing, from which art they called her Canens. The fascination of her voice would move the woods and rocks and tame wild beasts, and stay long rivers, and it even detained the wandering bird. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'"Picus in Ausoniis, proles Saturnia, terris<br>rex fuit, utilium bello studiosus equorum;<br>forma viro, quam cernis, erat: licet ipse decorem<br>adspicias fictaque probes ab imagine verum;<br>par animus formae; nec adhuc spectasse per annos<br>quinquennem poterat Graia quater Elide pugnam.<br>ille suos dryadas Latiis in montibus ortas<br>verterat in vultus, illum fontana petebant<br>numina, naiades, quas Albula, quasque Numici,<br>quas Anienis aquae cursuque brevissimus Almo<br>Narve tulit praeceps et opacae Farfarus umbrae,<br>quaeque colunt Scythicae stagnum nemorale Dianae<br>finitimosque lacus; spretis tamen omnibus unam<br>ille colit nymphen, quam quondam in colle Palati<br>dicitur ancipiti peperisse Venilia Iano.<br>haec ubi nubilibus primum maturuit annis,<br>praeposito cunctis Laurenti tradita Pico est,<br>rara quidem facie, sed rarior arte canendi,<br>unde Canens dicta est: silvas et saxa movere<br>et mulcere feras et flumina longa morari<br>ore suo volucresque vagas retinere solebat.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="341">“`Once, while she sang a lay with high, clear voice, Picus on his keen horse rode in Laurentian fields to hunt the boar, two spears in his left hand, his purple cloak fastened with gold. The daughter of the Sun wandered in woods near by to find new herbs growing on fertile hills, for she had left Circaean fields called so from her own name. From a concealing thicket she observed the youth with wonder. All the gathered herbs dropped from her hands, forgotten, to the ground and a hot fever-flame seemed to pervade her marrow. When she could collect her thought she wanted to confess her great desire, but the swift horse and his surrounding guards prevented her approach. “Still you shall not escape me,” she declared, “although you may be borne on winds, if I but know myself, and if some potency in herbs remains, and if my art of charms does not deceive.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">quae dum feminea modulatur carmina voce,<br>exierat tecto Laurentes Picus in agros<br>indigenas fixurus apros tergumque premebat<br>acris equi laevaque hastilia bina ferebat<br>poeniceam fulvo chlamydem contractus ab auro.<br>venerat in silvas et filia Solis easdem,<br>utque novas legeret fecundis collibus herbas,<br>nomine dicta suo Circaea reliquerat arva.<br>quae simul ac iuvenem virgultis abdita vidit,<br>obstipuit: cecidere manu, quas legerat, herbae,<br>flammaque per totas visa est errare medullas.<br>ut primum valido mentem conlegit ab aestu,<br>quid cuperet, fassura fuit: ne posset adire,<br>cursus equi fecit circumfususque satelles.<br>'non' ait 'effugies, vento rapiare licebit,<br>si modo me novi, si non evanuit omnis<br>herbarum virtus, nec me mea carmina fallunt.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="358">“`Such were her thoughts, and then she formed an image of a bodiless wild swine and let it cross the trail before the king and rush into a woodland dense with trees, which fallen trunks made pathless for his horse. Picus at once, unconscious of all harm, followed the phantom-prey and, hastily quitting the reeking back of his good steed, he wandered in pursuit of a vain hope, on foot through that deep wood. She seized the chance and by her incantation called strange gods with a strange charm, which had the power to hide the white moon's features and draw thirsty clouds about her father's head. The changing sky then lowered more black at each repeated tone of incantation, and the ground exhaled its vapours, while his people wandered there along the darkened paths until no guard was near to aid the imperiled king. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">dixit et effigiem nullo cum corpore falsi<br>fingit apri praeterque oculos transcurrere regis<br>iussit et in densum trabibus nemus ire videri,<br>plurima qua silva est et equo loca pervia non sunt.<br>haut mora, continuo praedae petit inscius umbram<br>Picus equique celer spumantia terga relinquit<br>spemque sequens vanam silva pedes errat in alta.<br>concipit illa preces et verba venefica dicit<br>ignotosque deos ignoto carmine adorat,<br>quo solet et niveae vultum confundere Lunae<br>et patrio capiti bibulas subtexere nubes.<br>tum quoque cantato densetur carmine caelum<br>et nebulas exhalat humus, caecisque vagantur<br>limitibus comites, et abest custodia regis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="372">“`Having now gained an opportunity and place, she said, “O, youth most beautiful! By those fine eyes, which captivated mine, and by that graceful person, which brings me, even me, a goddess, suppliant to you, have pity on my passion; let the Sun, who looks on all things, be your father-in-law; do not despise Circe, the Titaness.” But fiercely he repelled her and her prayer, “Whoever you may be, you are not mine,” he said. “Another lady has my heart. I pray that for a lengthening space of time she may so hold me. I will not pollute conjugal ties with the unhallowed loves of any stranger, while the Fates preserve to me the child of Janus, my dear Canens.” Titan's daughter, when many pleas had failed, said angrily, “You shall not leave me with impunity, and you shall not return to Canens; and by your experience you shall now learn what can be done by her so slighted—what a woman deep in love can do—and Circe is that slighted love.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">nacta locum tempusque 'per o, tua lumina,' dixit<br>'quae mea ceperunt, perque hanc, pulcherrime, formam,<br>quae facit, ut supplex tibi sim dea, consule nostris<br>ignibus et socerum, qui pervidet omnia, Solem<br>accipe nec durus Titanida despice Circen.'<br>dixerat; ille ferox ipsamque precesque repellit<br>et 'quaecumque es,' ait 'non sum tuus; altera captum<br>me tenet et teneat per longum, conprecor, aevum,<br>nec Venere externa socialia foedera laedam,<br>dum mihi Ianigenam servabunt fata Canentem.'<br>saepe retemptatis precibus Titania frustra<br>'non inpune feres, neque' ait 'reddere Canenti,<br>laesaque quid faciat, quid amans, quid femina, disces<br>rebus; at est et amans et laesa et femina Circe!'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="386">“`Then twice she turned herself to face the west and twice to face the East; and three times then she touched the young man with her wand, and sang three incantations. Picus fled, but, marvelling at his unaccustomed speed, he saw new wings, that spread on either side and bore him onward. Angry at the thought of transformation—all so suddenly added a strange bird to the Latian woods, he struck the wild oaks with his hard new beak, and in his rage inflicted many wounds on the long waving branches his wings took the purple of his robe. The piece of gold which he had used so nicely in his robe was changed to golden feathers, and his neck was rich as yellow gold. Nothing remained of Picus as he was except the name. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">tum bis ad occasus, bis se convertit ad ortus,<br>ter iuvenem baculo tetigit, tria carmina dixit.<br>ille fugit, sed se solito velocius ipse<br>currere miratur: pennas in corpore vidit,<br>seque novam subito Latiis accedere silvis<br>indignatus avem duro fera robora rostro<br>figit et iratus longis dat vulnera ramis;<br>purpureum chlamydis pennae traxere colorem;<br>fibula quod fuerat vestemque momorderat aurum,<br>pluma fit, et fulvo cervix praecingitur auro,<br>nec quicquam antiquum Pico nisi nomina restat.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="397">“`While all this happened his attendants called on Picus often but in vain throughout surrounding fields, and finding not a trace of their young king, at length by chance they met with Circe, who had cleared the darkened air and let the clouds disperse before the wind and clear rays of the sun. Then with good cause they blamed her, they demanded the return of their lost king, and with their hunting spears they threatened her. She, sprinkling baleful drugs and poison juices over them, invoked the aid of Night and all the gods of Night from Erebus and Chaos, and desired the aid of Hecat with long, wailing cries. Most wonderful to tell, the forests leaped from fixed localities and the torn soil uttered deep groans, the trees surrounding changed from life-green to sick pallor, and the grass was moistened with besprinkling drops of blood; the stones sent forth harsh longings, unknown dogs barked loudly, and the ground became a mass of filthy snakes, and unsubstantial hosts of the departed flitted without sound. The men all quaked appalled. With magic rod she touched their faces, pale and all amazed, and at her touch the youths took on strange forms of wild animals. None kept his proper shape. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'"Interea comites, clamato saepe per agros<br>nequiquam Pico nullaque in parte reperto,<br>inveniunt Circen (nam iam tenuaverat auras<br>passaque erat nebulas ventis ac sole recludi)<br>criminibusque premunt veris regemque reposcunt<br>vimque ferunt saevisque parant incessere telis:<br>illa nocens spargit virus sucosque veneni<br>et Noctem Noctisque deos Ereboque Chaoque<br>convocat et longis Hecaten ululatibus orat.<br>exsiluere loco (dictu mirabile) silvae,<br>ingemuitque solum, vincinaque palluit arbor,<br>sparsaque sanguineis maduerunt pabula guttis,<br>et lapides visi mugitus edere raucos<br>et latrare canes et humus serpentibus atris<br>squalere et tenues animae volitare silentum:<br>attonitum monstris vulgus pavet; illa paventis<br>ora venenata tetigit mirantia virga,<br>cuius ab attactu variarum monstra ferarum<br>in iuvenes veniunt: nulli sua mansit imago.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="416">“`The setting sun is resting low upon the far Tartessian shores, and now in vain her husband is expected by the eyes of longing Canens. Her slaves and people run about through all the forest, holding lights to meet him. Nor is it enough for that dear nymph to weep and frenzied tear her hair and beat her breast—she did all that and more. Distracted she rushed forth and wandered through the Latin fields. Six nights, six brightening dawns found her quite unrefreshed with food or sleep wandering at random over hill and dale. The Tiber saw her last, with grief and toil wearied and lying on his widespread bank. In tears she poured out words with a faint voice, lamenting her sad woe, as when the swan about to die sings a funereal dirge. Melting with grief at last she pined away; her flesh, her bones, her marrow liquified and vanished by degrees as formless air and yet the story lingers near that place, fitly named Canens by old-time Camenae!.’ <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'"Sparserat occiduus Tartessia litora Phoebus,<br>et frustra coniunx oculis animoque Canentis<br>exspectatus erat: famuli populusque per omnes<br>discurrunt silvas atque obvia lumina portant;<br>nec satis est nymphae flere et lacerare capillos<br>et dare plangorem (facit haec tamen omnia) seque<br>proripit ac Latios errat vesana per agros.<br>sex illam noctes, totidem redeuntia solis<br>lumina viderunt inopem somnique cibique<br>per iuga, per valles, qua fors ducebat, euntem;<br>ultimus adspexit Thybris luctuque viaque<br>fessam et iam longa ponentem corpora ripa.<br>illic cum lacrimis ipso modulata dolore<br>verba sono tenui maerens fundebat, ut olim<br>carmina iam moriens canit exequialia cycnus;<br>luctibus extremum tenues liquefacta medullas<br>tabuit inque leves paulatim evanuit auras,<br>fama tamen signata loco est, quem rite Canentem<br>nomine de nymphae veteres dixere Camenae."</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="435">“Such things I heard and saw through a long year. Sluggish, inactive through our idleness, we were all ordered to embark again out on the deep, again to set our sails.

And Aeneas' nurse, now buried in a marble urn, had this brief, strange inscription on her tomb:-- “My foster-child of proven piety, burned me Caieta here: although I was at first preserved from Argive fire, I later burned with fire which was my due.” The cable loosened from the grassy bank, they steered a course which kept them well away from ill famed Circe's wiles and from her home and sought the groves where Tiber dark with shade, breaks with his yellow sands into the sea. Aeneas then fell heir to the home and won the daughter of Latinus, Faunus' son, not without war. A people very fierce made war, and Turnus, their young chief, indignant fought to hold a promised bride. With Latium all Etruria was embroiled, a victory hard to win was sought through war. By foreign aid each side got further strength: the camp of Rutuli abounds in men, and many throng the opposing camp of Troy. Aeneas did not find Evander's home in vain. But Venulus with no success came to the realm of exiled Diomed. That hero had marked out his mighty walls with favor of Iapygian Daunus and held fields that came to him as marriage dower. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Finierat Macareus, urnaque Aeneia nutrix<br>condita marmorea tumulo breve carmen habebat<br>HIC ME CAIETAM NOTAE PIETATIS ALUMNUS<br>EREPTAM ARGOLICO QUO DEBUIT IGNE CREMAVIT<br>solvitur herboso religatus ab aggere funis,<br>et procul insidias infamataeque relinquunt<br>tecta deae lucosque petunt, ubi nubilus umbra<br>in mare cum flava prorumpit Thybris harena;<br>Faunigenaeque domo potitur nataque Latini,<br>non sine Marte tamen. bellum cum gente feroci<br>suscipitur, pactaque furit pro coniuge Turnus.<br>concurrit Latio Tyrrhenia tota, diuque<br>ardua sollicitis victoria quaeritur armis.<br>auget uterque suas externo robore vires,<br>et multi Rutulos, multi Troiana tuentur<br>castra, neque Aeneas Euandri ad moenia frustra,<br>at Venulus frustra profugi Diomedis ad urbem<br>venerat: ille quidem sub Iapyge maxima Dauno<br>moenia condiderat dotaliaque arva tenebat;</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="460">When Venulus, by Turnus' orders, made request for aid, the Aetolian hero said that he was poor in men: he did not wish to risk in battle himself nor any troops belonging to his father-in-law and had no troops of his that he could arm for battle. “Lest you should think I feign,” he then went on “Although my grief must be renewed because of bitter recollections of the past, I will endure recital now to you:-- “After the lofty Ilion was burnt and Pergama had fed the Grecian flames, and Ajax, the Narycian hero, had brought from a virgin, for a virgin wronged, the punishment which he alone deserved on our whole expedition, we were then dispersed and driven by violent winds over the hostile seas; and we, the Greeks, had to endure in darkness, lightning, rain, the wrath both of the heavens and of the sea, and Caphareus, the climax of our woe. Not to detain you by relating such unhappy things in order, Greece might then have seemed to merit even Priam's tears. Although well armed Minerva's care preserved me then and brought me safe through rocks and waves, from my native Argos I was driven again, for outraged Venus took her full revenge remembering still that wound of long ago; and I endured such hardships on the deep, and hazards amid armies on the shore, that often I called those happy whom the storm—an ill that came on all, or Cephareus had drowned.

Acmon, by nature hot, and much embittered by misfortune, said, `What now remains for you, my friends, that patience can endure? What can be done by Venus (if she wants to) more than she already has done? While we have a dread of greater evils, reason will be found for patience; but, when fortune brings her worst, we scorn and trample fear beneath our feet. Upon the height of woe, why should we care? Let Venus listen, let her hate Diomed more than all others—as indeed she does, we all despise her hate. At a great price we have bought and won the right to such contempt!’ With language of this kind Pleuronian Acmon. Provoking Venus further than before, revived her former anger. His fierce words were then approved of by a few, while we the greater number of his real friends, rebuked the words of Acmon: and while he prepared to answer us, his voice, and even the passage of his voice, were both at once diminished, his hair changed to feathers, while his neck took a new form. His breast and back covered themselves with down, and both his arms grew longer feathers, and his elbows curved into light wings, much of each foot was changed to long toes, and his mouth grew still and hard with pointed horn. Amazed at his swift change were Lycus, Abas, Nycteus and Rhexenor. And, while they stared, they took his feathered shape. The larger portion of my company flew from their boat, resounding all around our oars with flapping of new-fashioned wings.

Venulus soon after left the Calydonian realms, Peucetian bays, and the Messapian fields. Among those fields he saw a darkened cave in woods and waving reeds. The halfgoat Pan now lives there, but in older time the nymphs possessed it. An Apulian shepherd scared them from that spot. At first he terrified them with a sudden fear, but soon in scorn, as they considered what the intruder was, they danced before him, moving feet to time. The shepherd clown abused them, capering, grotesquely imitating graceful steps, and railed at them with coarse and foolish words. He was not silent till a tree's new bark had closed his mouth for now he is a tree. And the wild olive's fruit took bitterness from him. It has the tartness of his tongue. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hactenus Oenides, Venulus Calydonia regna<br>Peucetiosque sinus Messapiaque arva relinquit.<br>in quibus antra videt, quae, multa nubila silva<br>et levibus cannis latitantia semicaper Pan<br>nunc tenet, at quodam tenuerunt tempore nymphae.<br>Apulus has illa pastor regione fugatas<br>terruit et primo subita formidine movit,<br>mox, ubi mens rediit et contempsere sequentem,<br>ad numerum motis pedibus duxere choreas;<br>inprobat has pastor saltuque imitatus agresti<br>addidit obscenis convicia rustica dictis,<br>nec prius os tacuit, quam guttura condidit arbor:<br>arbor enim est, sucoque licet cognoscere mores.<br>quippe notam linguae bacis oleaster amaris<br>exhibet: asperitas verborum cessit in illa.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="527">When the ambassadors returned and told their tale about Aetolian arms refused, the bold Rutulians carried on the war without those forces, and much blood was shed. Then Turnus with a greedy torch drew near the Trojan fleet, well built of close-knit pine. What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame. Soon Mulciber was burning pitch and wax and other food of fire, up the high masts he ran and fed upon the tight furled sails, and even the benches in the curved hull smoked. When the holy mother of the gods, recalling how those same pines were felled on Ida's crest, filled the wind with a sound of cymbals clashed and trill of boxwood flutes. Borne through light air by her famed lion yoke, she came and said, “In vain you cast the fire with impious hand, Turnus, for I will save this burning fleet. I will not let the greedy flame consume trees that were part and members of my grove.” It thundered while she spoke, and heavy clouds, following the thunder, brought a storm of bounding hail. The Astraean brothers filled both air and swollen waters with their rage and rushed to battle. With the aid of one of them the kindly mother broke the ropes which held the Phrygian ships, and, drawing all prow foremost, plunged them underneath the wave. Softening quickly in the waters quiet depth, their wood was changed to flesh, the curving prows were metamorphosed into human heads, blades of the oars made feet, the looms were changed to swimming legs, the sides turned human flanks, each keel below the middle of a ship transformed became a spine, the cordage changed to soft hair, and the sail yards changed to arms. The azure color of the ships remained. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hinc ubi legati rediere, negata ferentes<br>arma Aetola sibi, Rutuli sine viribus illis<br>bella instructa gerunt, multumque ab utraque cruoris<br>parte datur; fert ecce avidas in pinea Turnus<br>texta faces, ignesque timent, quibus unda pepercit.<br>iamque picem et ceras alimentaque cetera flammae<br>Mulciber urebat perque altum ad carbasa malum<br>ibat, et incurvae fumabant transtra carinae,<br>cum memor has pinus Idaeo vertice caesas<br>sancta deum genetrix tinnitibus aera pulsi<br>aeris et inflati conplevit murmure buxi<br>perque leves domitis invecta leonibus auras<br>'inrita sacrilega iactas incendia dextra,<br>Turne!' ait.

Natives of the rugged mountains they are now so changed, they swim and dwell in the soft flowing sea, with every influence of birth forgot. Never forgetful of the myriad risks they have endured among the boisterous waves, they often give a helping hand to ships tossed in the power of storms—unless, of course, the ship might carry men of Grecian race. Never forgetful of the Phrygians and catastrophe, their hatred was so great of all Pelasgians, that they looked with joy upon the fragments of Ulysses' ship; and were delighted when they saw the ship of King Alcinous growing hard upon the breakers, as its wood was turned to stone. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">caerulus, ut fuerat, color est; quasque ante timebant,<br>illas virgineis exercent lusibus undas<br>Naides aequoreae durisque in montibus ortae<br>molle fretum celebrant nec eas sua tangit origo;<br>non tamen oblitae, quam multa pericula saepe<br>pertulerint pelago, iactatis saepe carinis<br>subposuere manus, nisi siqua vehebat Achivos:<br>cladis adhuc Phrygiae memores odere Pelasgos<br>Neritiaeque ratis viderunt fragmina laetis<br>vultibus et laetis videre rigescere puppim<br>vultibus Alcinoi saxumque increscere ligno.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="566">Many were hopeful that a fleet which had received life strangely in the forms of nymphs would cause the chieftain of the Rutuli to feel such awe that he would end their strife. But he continued fighting, and each side had its own gods, and each had courage too, which often can be as potent as the gods. Now they forgot the kingdom as a dower, forgot the scepter of a father-in-law, and even forgot the pure Lavinia: their one thought was to conquer, and they waged war to prevent the shame of a defeat. But Venus finally beheld the arms of her victorious son; for Turnus fell, and Ardea fell, a town which, while he lived, was counted strong. The Trojan swords destroyed it.—All its houses burned and sank down in the heated embers: and a bird not known before that time, flew upward from a wrecked heap, beating the dead ashes with its flapping wings. The voice, the lean pale look, the sorrows of a captured city, even the name of the ruined city, all these things remain in that bird—Ardea's fallen walls are beaten in lamentation by his wings. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Spes erat, in nymphas animata classe marinas<br>posse metu monstri Rutulum desistere bello:<br>perstat, habetque deos pars utraque, quodque deorum est<br>instar, habent animos; nec iam dotalia regna,<br>nec sceptrum soceri, nec te, Lavinia virgo,<br>sed vicisse petunt deponendique pudore<br>bella gerunt, tandemque Venus victricia nati<br>arma videt, Turnusque cadit: cadit Ardea, Turno<br>sospite dicta potens; quam postquam barbarus ignis<br>abstulit et tepida latuerunt tecta favilla,<br>congerie e media tum primum cognita praepes<br>subvolat et cineres plausis everberat alis.<br>et sonus et macies et pallor et omnia, captam<br>quae deceant urbem, nomen quoque mansit in illa<br>urbis, et ipsa suis deplangitur Ardea pennis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="581">The merit of Aeneas now had moved the gods. Even Juno stayed her lasting hate, when, with the state of young Iulus safe, the hero son of Cytherea was prepared for heaven. In a council of the gods Venus arose, embraced her father's neck, and said: “ My father, ever kind to me, I do beseech your kind indulgence now; grant, dearest, to Aeneas, my own son and also your own grandson, grant to him a godhead power, although of lowest class, sufficient if but granted. It is enough to have looked once upon the unlovely realm. And once to have gone across the Stygian streams.” The gods assented, and the queen of Jove nodded consent with calm, approving face. The father said, “You well deserve the gift, both you who ask it, and the one for whom you ask it: what you most desire is yours, my daughter.” He decreed, and she rejoiced and thanked her parent. Borne by harnessed doves over and through the light air, she arrived safe on Laurentine shores: Numicius there winds through his tall reeds to the neighboring sea the waters of his stream: and there she willed Numicius should wash perfectly away from her Aeneas every part that might be subject unto death; and bear it far with quiet current into Neptune's realm. The horned Numicius satisfied the will of Venus; and with flowing waters washed from her Aeneas every mortal part, and sprinkled him, so that the essential part of immortality remained alone, and she anointed him, thus purified, with heavenly essence, and she touched his face with sweetest nectar and ambrosia mixt, thereby transforming him into a god. The throng of the Quirini later named the new god Indiges, and honored him. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque deos omnes ipsamque Aeneia virtus<br>Iunonem veteres finire coegerat iras,<br>cum, bene fundatis opibus crescentis Iuli,<br>tempestivus erat caelo Cythereius heros.<br>ambieratque Venus superos colloque parentis<br>circumfusa sui 'numquam mihi' dixerat 'ullo<br>tempore dure pater, nunc sis mitissimus, opto,<br>Aeneaeque meo, qui te de sanguine nostro<br>fecit avum, quamvis parvum des, optime, numen,<br>dummodo des aliquod! satis est inamabile regnum<br>adspexisse semel, Stygios semel isse per amnes.'<br>adsensere dei, nec coniunx regia vultus<br>inmotos tenuit placatoque adnuit ore;<br>tum pater 'estis' ait 'caelesti munere digni,<br>quaeque petis pro quoque petis: cape, nata, quod optas!'<br>fatus erat: gaudet gratesque agit illa parenti<br>perque leves auras iunctis invecta columbis<br>litus adit Laurens, ubi tectus harundine serpit<br>in freta flumineis vicina Numicius undis.<br>hunc iubet Aeneae, quaecumque obnoxia morti,<br>abluere et tacito deferre sub aequora cursu;<br>corniger exsequitur Veneris mandata suisque,<br>quicquid in Aenea fuerat mortale, repurgat<br>et respersit aquis; pars optima restitit illi.<br>lustratum genetrix divino corpus odore<br>unxit et ambrosia cum dulci nectare mixta<br>contigit os fecitque deum, quem turba Quirini<br>nuncupat Indigetem temploque arisque recepit.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Vertumnus and Pomona</h4><ol><ruby value="609">Under the scepter of Ascanius the Latin state, transferred, was Alban too. Silvius ruled after him. Latinus then, wearing the crown, brought back an older name. Illustrious Alba followed after him, Epytus next in time, and Capys next, then Capetus. And reigning after them King Tiberinus followed. He was drowned in waves of that Etrurian stream, to which he gave his name. His sons were Remulus and fierce Acrota—each in turn was king. The elder, Remulus, would imitate the lightning, and he perished by a flash of lightning. Then Acrota, not so rash, succeeded to his brother, and he left his scepter to the valiant Aventinus, hill-buried on the very mountain which he ruled upon and which received his name. And Proca ruled then—on the Palatine. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Inde sub Ascanii dicione binominis Alba<br>resque Latina fuit. succedit Silvius illi.<br>quo satus antiquo tenuit repetita Latinus<br>nomina cum sceptro, clarus subit Alba Latinum.<br>Epytus ex illo est; post hunc Capetusque Capysque,<br>sed Capys ante fuit; regnum Tiberinus ab illis<br>cepit et in Tusci demersus fluminis undis<br>nomina fecit aquae; de quo Remulusque feroxque<br>Acrota sunt geniti.

She cared not for the forests or the streams, but loved the country and the boughs that bear delicious fruit. Her right hand never felt a javelin's weight, always she loved to hold a sharp curved pruning-knife with which she would at one time crop too largely growing shoots, or at another time reduce the branch that straggled; at another time she would engraft a sucker in divided bark, and so find nourishment for some young, strange nursling. She never suffered them to thirst, for she would water every winding thread of twisting roots with freshly flowing streams. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Rege sub hoc Pomona fuit, qua nulla Latinas<br>inter hamadryadas coluit sollertius hortos<br>nec fuit arborei studiosior altera fetus;<br>unde tenet nomen: non silvas illa nec amnes,<br>rus amat et ramos felicia poma ferentes;<br>nec iaculo gravis est, sed adunca dextera falce,<br>qua modo luxuriem premit et spatiantia passim<br>bracchia conpescit, fisso modo cortice virgam<br>inserit et sucos alieno praestat alumno;<br>nec sentire sitim patitur bibulaeque recurvas<br>radicis fibras labentibus inrigat undis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="634">All this was her delight, her chief pursuit; she never felt the least desire of love; but fearful of some rustic's violence, she had her orchard closed within a wall; and both forbade and fled the approach of males. What did not satyrs do to gain her love, a youthful crew expert at every dance? And also Pans their brows wreathed with the pine, Silenus too, more youthful than his years, and that god who is ever scaring thieves with pruning-hook or limb—what did they not to gain her love? And though Vertumnus did exceed them in his love, yet he was not more fortunate than they. How often disguised as a rough reaper he brought her barley ears—truly he seemed a reaper to the life! Often he came, his temples wreathed with hay, as if he had been tossing new mown grass. He often held a whip in his tough hand, you could have sworn he had a moment before unyoked his wearied oxen. When he had a pruning-knife, he seemed to rear fine fruit in orchard trees or in the well kept vines. When he came with a ladder, you would think he must be gathering fruit. Sometimes he was a soldier with a sword—a fisherman, the rod held in his hand.—In fact by means of many shapes he often had obtained access to her and joyed in seeing her beauty. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">hic amor, hoc studium, Veneris quoque nulla cupido est;<br>vim tamen agrestum metuens pomaria claudit<br>intus et accessus prohibet refugitque viriles.<br>quid non et Satyri, saltatibus apta iuventus,<br>fecere et pinu praecincti cornua Panes<br>Silvanusque, suis semper iuvenilior annis,<br>quique deus fures vel falce vel inguine terret,<br>ut poterentur ea? sed enim superabat amando<br>hos quoque Vertumnus neque erat felicior illis.<br>o quotiens habitu duri messoris aristas<br>corbe tulit verique fuit messoris imago!<br>tempora saepe gerens faeno religata recenti<br>desectum poterat gramen versasse videri;<br>saepe manu stimulos rigida portabat, ut illum<br>iurares fessos modo disiunxisse iuvencos.<br>falce data frondator erat vitisque putator;<br>induerat scalas: lecturum poma putares;<br>miles erat gladio, piscator harundine sumpta;<br>denique per multas aditum sibi saepe figuras<br>repperit, ut caperet spectatae gaudia formae.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="654">At length he had his brows bound with a cap of color, and then leaning on a stick, with white hair round his temples, he assumed the shape of an old woman. Entering so the cultivated garden, he admired the fruit and said, “But you are so much lovelier!” And, while he praised her, gave some kisses too, such as no real beldame ever gave. The bent old creature then sat on the grass. Gazing at branches weighed down with their fruit of autumn. Opposite to them there was an elm-tree beautiful with shining grapes; and, after he had praised it with the vine embracing it, he said, “But only think, if this trunk stood unwedded to this vine, it would have nothing to attract our hearts beyond its leaves, and this delightful vine, united to the elm tree finds its rest; but, if not so joined to it, would fall down, prostrate upon the ground. And yet you find no warning in the example of this tree. You have avoided marriage, with no wish to be united -- I must wish that you would change and soon desire it. Helen would not have so many suitors for her hand, nor she who caused the battles of the Lapithae, nor would the wife of timid, and not bold, Ulysses. Even now, while you avoid those who are courting you, and while you turn in your disgust, a thousand suitors want to marry you—the demigods and gods, and deities of Alba's mountain-tops. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ille etiam picta redimitus tempora mitra,<br>innitens baculo, positis per tempora canis,<br>adsimulavit anum: cultosque intravit in hortos<br>pomaque mirata est 'tanto' que 'potentior!' inquit<br>paucaque laudatae dedit oscula, qualia numquam<br>vera dedisset anus, glaebaque incurva resedit<br>suspiciens pandos autumni pondere ramos.<br>ulmus erat contra speciosa nitentibus uvis:<br>quam socia postquam pariter cum vite probavit,<br>'at si staret' ait 'caelebs sine palmite truncus,<br>nil praeter frondes, quare peteretur, haberet;<br>haec quoque, quae iuncta est, vitis requiescit in ulmo:<br>si non nupta foret, terrae acclinata iaceret;<br>tu tamen exemplo non tangeris arboris huius<br>concubitusque fugis nec te coniungere curas.<br>atque utinam velles!

Despise all common persons, and choose now Vertumnus as the partner of your couch, and you may take me as a surety for him. He is not better known even to himself, than he is known to me. And he is not now wandering everywhere, from here to there throughout the world. He always will frequent the places near here; and he does not, like so many of your wooers, fall in love with her he happens to have seen the last. You are his first and last love, and to you alone will he devote his life. Besides all—he is young and has a natural gift of grace, so that he can most readily transform himself to any wanted shape, and will become whatever you may wish—even though you ask him things unseen before. And only think, have you not the same tastes? Will he not be the first to welcome fruits which are your great delight? And does he not hold your gifts safely in his glad right hand? But now he does not long for any fruit plucked from the tree, and has no thought of herbs with pleasant juices that the garden gives; he cannot think of anything but you. Have pity on his passion, and believe that he who woos you is here and he pleads with my lips. You should not forget to fear avenging deities, and the Idalian, who hate all cruel hearts, and also dread the fierce revenge of her of Rhamnus-Land. And that you may stand more in awe of them, (old age has given me opportunities of knowing many things) I will relate some happenings known in Cyprus, by which you may be persuaded and relent with ease. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">sed tu si sapies, si te bene iungere anumque<br>hanc audire voles, quae te plus omnibus illis,<br>plus, quam credis, amo: vulgares reice taedas<br>Vertumnumque tori socium tibi selige! pro quo<br>me quoque pignus habe: neque enim sibi notior ille est,<br>quam mihi; nec passim toto vagus errat in orbe,<br>haec loca sola colit; nec, uti pars magna procorum,<br>quam modo vidit, amat: tu primus et ultimus illi<br>ardor eris, solique suos tibi devovet annos.<br>adde, quod est iuvenis, quod naturale decoris<br>munus habet formasque apte fingetur in omnes,<br>et quod erit iussus, iubeas licet omnia, fiet.<br>quid, quod amatis idem, quod, quae tibi poma coluntur,<br>primus habet laetaque tenet tua munera dextra!<br>sed neque iam fetus desiderat arbore demptos<br>nec, quas hortus alit, cum sucis mitibus herbas<br>nec quicquam nisi te: miserere ardentis et ipsum,<br>qui petit, ore meo praesentem crede precari.<br>ultoresque deos et pectora dura perosam<br>Idalien memoremque time Rhamnusidis iram!<br>quoque magis timeas, (etenim mihi multa vetustas<br>scire dedit) referam tota notissima Cypro<br>facta, quibus flecti facile et mitescere possis.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Anaxarete Transformed</h4><ol><ruby value="698">“Iphis, born of a humble family, had seen the famed Anaxarete, who was of the race of ancient Teucer.—He had seen her and felt fire inflame his bones. Struggling a long time, he could not subdue his passion by his reason, so he came a suppliant to her doors. And having now confessed his ardent passion to her nurse, besought her by the hopes reposed in her by the loved girl, not to give him a cold heart and at another time, with fair words given to each of many servants he besought their kindest interest with an anxious voice. He often gave them coaxing words engraved on tablets of soft wax; and sometimes he would fasten garlands, wet with dew of tears, upon the door-posts; and he often laid his tender side nightlong on the hard threshold, sadly reproaching the obdurate bolt. Deafer than the deep sea that rises high when the rainy Constellation of the Kids is setting; harder than the iron which the fire of Noricum refines; more hard than rock which in its native state is fixed firm rooted; she despised and laughed at him and, adding to her cruel deeds and pride, she boasted and deprived him of all hope. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Viderat a veteris generosam sanguine Teucri<br>Iphis Anaxareten, humili de stirpe creatus,<br>viderat et totis perceperat ossibus aestum<br>luctatusque diu, postquam ratione furorem<br>vincere non potuit, supplex ad limina venit<br>et modo nutrici miserum confessus amorem,<br>ne sibi dura foret, per spes oravit alumnae,<br>et modo de multis blanditus cuique ministris<br>sollicita petiit propensum voce favorem;<br>saepe ferenda dedit blandis sua verba tabellis,<br>interdum madidas lacrimarum rore coronas<br>postibus intendit posuitque in limine duro<br>molle latus tristisque serae convicia fecit.<br>saevior illa freto surgente cadentibus Haedis,<br>durior et ferro, quod Noricus excoquit ignis,<br>et saxo, quod adhuc vivum radice tenetur,<br>spernit et inridet, factisque inmitibus addit<br>verba superba ferox et spe quoque fraudat amantem.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="716">“Iphis, unable to endure such pain prolonged, spoke these, his final words, before her door: `Anaxarete, you have conquered me, and you shall have no more annoyances to bear from me. Be joyful and prepare your triumph, and invoke god Paean, crown yourself with shining laurel. You are now my conqueror, and I resigned will die. Woman of iron, rejoice in victory! At least, you will commend me for one thing, one point in which I must please even you, and cause you to confess my right of praise. Remember that my star crossed love for you died only with the last breath of my life. And now in one short moment I shall be deprived a twofold light; and no report will come to you, no messenger of death. But doubt not, I will come to you so that I can be seen in person, and you may then satiate your cruel eyesight with my lifeless body. If, you gods above! You have some knowledge of our mortal ways remember me, for now my tongue can pray no longer. Let me be renowned in times far distant and give all those hours to Fame which you have taken from my life on earth.’ Then to the doorpost which he often had adorned with floral wreaths he lifted up his swimming eyes and both his pallid arms, and, when he had fastened over the capital a rope that held a dangling noose, he said,—`Are these the garlands that delight your heart? You cruel and unnatural woman?'— Then, thrust in his head, turning even then towards her, and hung a hapless weight with broken neck. The door, struck by the motion of his feet as they were quivering, seemed to utter sounds of groaning, and, when it flew open, showed the sad sight. All the servants cried aloud, and after they had tried in vain to save him, carried him from there to his mother's house, (to her because his father was then dead). <rtc lang="la" translate="no">non tulit impatiens longi tormenta doloris<br>Iphis et ante fores haec verba novissima dixit:<br>"vincis, Anaxarete, neque erunt tibi taedia tandem<br>ulla ferenda mei: laetos molire triumphos<br>et Paeana voca nitidaque incingere lauru!<br>vincis enim, moriorque libens: age, ferrea, gaude!<br>certe aliquid laudare mei cogeris amoris,<br>quo tibi sim gratus, meritumque fatebere nostrum.<br>non tamen ante tui curam excessisse memento<br>quam vitam geminaque simul mihi luce carendum.<br>nec tibi fama mei ventura est nuntia leti:<br>ipse ego, ne dubites, adero praesensque videbor,<br>corpore ut exanimi crudelia lumina pascas.<br>si tamen, o superi, mortalia facta videtis,<br>este mei memores (nihil ultra lingua precari<br>sustinet) et longo facite ut narremur in aevo,<br>et, quae dempsistis vitae, date tempora famae!"<br>dixit, et ad postes ornatos saepe coronis<br>umentes oculos et pallida bracchia tollens,<br>cum foribus laquei religaret vincula summis,<br>"haec tibi serta placent, crudelis et inpia!" dixit<br>inseruitque caput, sed tum quoque versus ad illam,<br>atque onus infelix elisa fauce pependit.<br>icta pedum motu trepidantum aperire iubentem<br>visa dedisse sonum est adapertaque ianua factum<br>prodidit, exclamant famuli frustraque levatum<br>(nam pater occiderat) referunt ad limina matris;</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="743">“She held him to her bosom and embraced the cold limbs of her dead child. After she had uttered words so natural to the grief of wretched mothers—after she had done what wretched mothers do at such sad times, she led a tearful funeral through the streets, the pale corpse following high upon the bier, on to a pyre laid in the central square. By chance, Anaxarete's house was near the way through which the mournful funeral was going with the corpse, and the sad sound of wailing reached the ears of that proud girl—hardhearted, and already goaded on by an avenging god. Moved by the sound, she said; `Let me observe their sniveling rites.' And she ascended to an upper room, provided with wide windows. Scarcely had she looked at Iphis, laid out on the bier, when her eyes stiffened, and she turned all white, as warm blood left her body. She tried then to turn back from the window, but she stood transfixed there. She then tried to turn her face away from that sad sight, but could not move; and by degrees the stone, which always had existed, petrified in her cold breast, and took possession of her heart and limbs. This is not fiction, and that you may know, Salamis keeps that statue safe today, formed of the virgin and has also built a temple called, `Venus the watchful Goddess.’ Warned by her fate, O sweet nymph, lay aside prolonged disdain, and cheerfully unite yourself to one who loves you. Then may frost of springtime never nip your fruit in bud, nor rude winds strike the blossom.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">accipit illa sinu conplexaque frigida nati<br>membra sui postquam miserorum verba parentum<br>edidit et matrum miserarum facta peregit,<br>funera ducebat mediam lacrimosa per urbem<br>luridaque arsuro portabat membra feretro.<br>forte viae vicina domus, qua flebilis ibat<br>pompa, fuit, duraeque sonus plangoris ad aures<br>venit Anaxaretes, quam iam deus ultor agebat.<br>mota tamen "videamus" ait "miserabile funus"<br>et patulis iniit tectum sublime fenestris<br>vixque bene inpositum lecto prospexerat Iphin:<br>deriguere oculi, calidusque e corpore sanguis<br>inducto pallore fugit, conataque retro<br>ferre pedes haesit, conata avertere vultus<br>hoc quoque non potuit, paulatimque occupat artus,<br>quod fuit in duro iam pridem pectore, saxum.<br>neve ea ficta putes, dominae sub imagine signum<br>servat adhuc Salamis, Veneris quoque nomine templum<br>Prospicientis habet.Æquorum memor, o mea, lentos<br>pone, precor, fastus et amanti iungere, nymphe:<br>sic tibi nec vernum nascentia frigus adurat<br>poma, nec excutiant rapidi florentia venti!'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="765">When the god, fitted for every shape, had said these words in vain he laid the old woman's form aside and was again a youth. On her he seemed to blaze, as when the full light of the brilliant Sun, after it has dispelled opposing clouds, has shone forth with not one to intercept. He purposed violence, but there was then no need of force. The lovely nymph was charmed, was captivated by the god's bright form and felt a passion answering to his love. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi nequiquam formae deus aptus anili<br>edidit, in iuvenem rediit et anilia demit<br>instrumenta sibi talisque apparuit illi,<br>qualis ubi oppositas nitidissima solis imago<br>evicit nubes nullaque obstante reluxit,<br>vimque parat: sed vi non est opus, inque figura<br>capta dei nympha est et mutua vulnera sensit.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Tales about Romulus</h4><ol><ruby value="772">At Proca's death unjust Amulius seized with his troops the whole Ausonian wealth. And yet old Numitor, obtaining aid from his two grandsons, won the land again which he had lost; and on the festival of Pales were the city walls begun. King Tatius with his Sabines went to war; Tarpeia, who betrayed the citadel, died justly underneath the weight of arms. Then troops from Cures crept, like silent wolves, without a word toward men subdued by sleep and tried the gates that Ilia's son had barred. Then Saturn's daughter opened wide a gate, turning the silent hinge. Venus alone perceived the bars of that gate falling down. She surely would have closed it, were it not impossible for any deity to countervail the acts of other gods. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Proximus Ausonias iniusti miles Amuli<br>rexit opes, Numitorque senex amissa nepotis<br>munere regna capit, festisque Palilibus urbis<br>moenia conduntur; Tatiusque patresque Sabini<br>bella gerunt, arcisque via Tarpeia reclusa<br>dignam animam poena congestis exuit armis;<br>inde sati Curibus tacitorum more luporum<br>ore premunt voces et corpora victa sopore<br>invadunt portasque petunt, quas obice firmo<br>clauserat Iliades: unam tamen ipse reclusit<br>nec strepitum verso Saturnia cardine fecit;<br>sola Venus portae cecidisse repagula sensit<br>et clausura fuit, nisi quod rescindere numquam<br>dis licet acta deum.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="785">The Naiads of Ausonia occupied a spring that welled up close to Janus' fane. To them she prayed for aid. The fountain-nymphs could not resist the prayer of Venus, when she made her worthy plea and they released all waters under ground. Till then the path by Janus' fane was open, never yet had floods risen to impede the way. But now they laid hot sulphur of a faint blue light beneath the streaming fountain and with care applied fire to the hallowed ways with smoking pitch. By these and many other violent means hot vapors penetrated to the source of the good fountain.—Only think of it! Those waters which had rivalled the cold Alps, now rivalled with their heat the flames themselves! And, while each gate post steamed with boiling spray, the gate, which had been opened (but in vain) to hardy Sabines just outside, was made impassable by the heated fountain's flood, till Roman soldiers had regained their arms. After brave Romulus had led them forth and covered Roman ground with Sabines dead and its own people; and the accursed sword shed blood of father-in-law and son-in-law, with peace they chose at last to end the war, rather than fight on to the bitter end: Tatius and Romulus divide the throne. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iano loca iuncta tenebant<br>naides Ausoniae gelido rorantia fonte:<br>has rogat auxilium, nec nymphae iusta petentem<br>sustinuere deam venasque et flumina fontis<br>elicuere sui; nondum tamen invia Iani<br>ora patentis erant, neque iter praecluserat unda:<br>lurida subponunt fecundo sulphura fonti<br>incenduntque cavas fumante bitumine venas.<br>viribus his aliisque vapor penetravit ad ima<br>fontis, et Alpino modo quae certare rigori<br>audebatis aquae, non ceditis ignibus ipsis!<br>flammifera gemini fumant aspergine postes,<br>portaque nequiquam rigidis promissa Sabinis<br>fonte fuit praestructa novo, dum Martius arma<br>indueret miles; quae postquam Romulus ultro<br>obtulit, et strata est tellus Romana Sabinis<br>corporibus strata estque suis, generique cruorem<br>sanguine cum soceri permiscuit inpius ensis.<br>pace tamen sisti bellum nec in ultima ferro<br>decertare placet Tatiumque accedere regno.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="805">Tatius had fallen, and you, O Romulus, were giving laws to peoples now made one, when Mars put off his helmet and addressed the father of gods and men in words like these: “The time has come, for now the Roman state has been established on a strong foundation and no more must rely on one man's strength the time has come for you to give the prize, promised to me and your deserving grandson, to raise him from the earth and grant him here a fitting place in heaven. One day you said to me before a council of the gods, (for I recall now with a grateful mind how I took note of your most gracious speech) `Him you shall lift up to the blue of heaven.’ Now let all know the meaning of your words!” The god all-powerful nodded his assent, and he obscured the air with heavy clouds and on a trembling world he sent below harsh thunder and bright lightning. Mars at once perceived it was a signal plainly given for promised change—so, leaning on a spear, he mounted boldly into his chariot, and over bloodstained yoke and eager steeds he swung and cracked the loud-resounding lash. Descending through steep air, he halted on the wooded summit of the Palatine and there, while Ilia's son was giving laws—needing no pomp and circumstance of kings, Mars caught him up. His mortal flesh dissolved into thin air, as when a ball of lead shot up from a broad sling melts all away and soon is lost in heaven. A nobler shape was given him, one more fitted to adorn rich couches in high heaven, the shape divine of Quirinus clad in the trabea. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Occiderat Tatius, populisque aequata duobus,<br>Romule, iura dabas: posita cum casside Mavors<br>talibus adfatur divumque hominumque parentem:<br>'tempus adest, genitor, quoniam fundamine magno<br>res Romana valet nec praeside pendet ab uno,<br>praemia, (sunt promissa mihi dignoque nepoti)<br>solvere et ablatum terris inponere caelo.<br>tu mihi concilio quondam praesente deorum<br>(nam memoro memorique animo pia verba notavi)<br>"unus erit, quem tu tolles in caerula caeli"<br>dixisti: rata sit verborum summa tuorum!'<br>adnuit omnipotens et nubibus aera caecis<br>occuluit tonitruque et fulgure terruit orbem.<br>quae sibi promissae sensit rata signa rapinae,<br>innixusque hastae pressos temone cruento<br>inpavidus conscendit equos Gradivus et ictu<br>verberis increpuit pronusque per aera lapsus<br>constitit in summo nemorosi colle Palati<br>reddentemque suo iam regia iura Quiriti<br>abstulit Iliaden: corpus mortale per auras<br>dilapsum tenues, ceu lata plumbea funda<br>missa solet medio glans intabescere caelo;<br>pulchra subit facies et pulvinaribus altis<br>dignior, est qualis trabeati forma Quirini.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="829">His queen, Hersilia, wept continually, regarding him as lost, till regal Juno commanded Iris to glide down along her curving bow and bring to her these words: “O matron, glory of the Latin race and of the Sabines, worthy to have been the consort chosen by so great a man and now to be his partner as the god Quirinus, weep no more. If you desire to see your husband, let me guide you up to a grove that crowns the hill of Quirinus, shading a temple of the Roman king.” Iris obeyed her will, and, gliding down to earth along her tinted bow, conveyed the message to Hersilia; who replied, with modest look and hardly lifted eye, “Goddess (although it is not in my power to say your name, I am quite certain you must be a goddess), lead me, O lead me until you show to me the hallowed form of my beloved husband. If the Fates will but permit me once again to see his features, I will say I have won heaven.” At once Hersilia and the virgin child of Thaumas, went together up the hill of Romulus. Descending through thin air there came a star, and then Hersilia her tresses glowing fiery in the light, rose with that star, as it returned through air. And her the founder of the Roman state received with dear, familiar hands. He changed her old time form and with the form her name. He called her Hora and let her become a goddess, now the mate of Quirinus. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Flebat ut amissum coniunx, cum regia Iuno<br>Irin ad Hersilien descendere limite curvo<br>imperat et vacuae sua sic mandata referre:<br>'o et de Latia, o et de gente Sabina<br>praecipuum, matrona, decus, dignissima tanti<br>ante fuisse viri coniunx, nunc esse Quirini,<br>siste tuos fletus, et, si tibi cura videndi<br>coniugis est, duce me lucum pete, colle Quirini<br>qui viret et templum Romani regis obumbrat';<br>paret et in terram pictos delapsa per arcus,<br>Hersilien iussis conpellat vocibus Iris;<br>illa verecundo vix tollens lumina vultu<br>'o dea (namque mihi nec, quae sis, dicere promptum est,<br>et liquet esse deam) duc, o duc' inquit 'et offer<br>coniugis ora mihi, quae si modo posse videre<br>fata semel dederint, caelum accepisse fatebor!'<br>nec mora, Romuleos cum virgine Thaumantea<br>ingreditur colles: ibi sidus ab aethere lapsum<br>decidit in terras; a cuius lumine flagrans<br>Hersilie crinis cum sidere cessit in auras:<br>hanc manibus notis Romanae conditor urbis<br>excipit et priscum pariter cum corpore nomen<br>mutat Horamque vocat, quae nunc dea iuncta Quirino est.</rtc></ruby></ol><nav><a href="#!/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/metamorphoses/book13/" rel="prev">Previous</a> <a href="#!/metamorphoses/book15/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><small>Translated by <span itemprop="translator">Brookes More</span>, <span itemprop="copyrightYear">1922</span>.<br>Original Latin and English translation are in public domain.</small></article>
