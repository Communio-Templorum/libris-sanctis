When the sons of Boreas had landed on the shore, and seen the Harpies snatching from the king his nourishment, befouling it with beaks obscene, they drove those human-vultures thence. And having suffered hardships and great toils, after the day they rescued the sad king from the vile Harpies, those twin valiant youths, Zetes and Calais came with their chief, the mighty Jason, where the Phasis flows. From the green margin of that river, all the crew of Argonauts, by Jason led, went to the king Aeetes and required the Golden Fleece, that he received from Phryxus. When they had bargained with him, full of wiles he offered to restore the Golden Fleece only to those who might to him return, victorious from hard labors of great risk. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque fretum Minyae Pagasaea puppe secabant,<br>perpetuaque trahens inopem sub nocte senectam<br>Phineus visus erat, iuvenesque Aquilone creati<br>virgineas volucres miseri senis ore fugarant,<br>multaque perpessi claro sub Iasone tandem<br>contigerant rapidas limosi Phasidos undas.<br>dumque adeunt regem Phrixeaque vellera poscunt</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="8">Medea, the king's daughter, near his throne, saw Jason, leader of the Argonauts, as he was pressing to secure a prize—and loved at sight with a consuming flame. Although she struggled to suppress her love, unable to restrain herself, she said, “In vain I've striven to subdue my heart: some god it must be, which I cannot tell, is working to destroy my hapless life; or else it is the burning flame of love that in me rages. If it is not love, why do the mandates of my father seem too harsh? They surely are too harsh. Why do I fear that he may perish whom I have seen only once? What is the secret cause that I am agitated by such fears?—It is no other than the god of Love. Thrust from your virgin breast such burning flames and overcome their hot unhappiness—if I could do so, I should be myself: but some deluding power is holding me helpless against my will. Desire persuades me one way, but my reason still persuades another way. I see a better course and I approve, but follow its defeat. —O royal maiden, why are you consumed with love for this strange man, and why are you so willing to be carried by the nuptial ties so far from your own country, where, indeed, are many brave men worthy of your love? <rtc lang="la" translate="no">lexque datur Minyis magnorum horrenda laborum,<br>concipit interea validos Aeetias ignes<br>et luctata diu, postquam ratione furorem<br>vincere non poterat, 'frustra, Medea, repugnas:<br>nescio quis deus obstat,' ait, 'mirumque, nisi hoc est,<br>aut aliquid certe simile huic, quod amare vocatur.<br>nam cur iussa patris nimium mihi dura videntur?<br>sunt quoque dura nimis! cur, quem modo denique vidi,<br>ne pereat, timeo? quae tanti causa timoris?<br>excute virgineo conceptas pectore flammas,<br>si potes, infelix! si possem, sanior essem!<br>sed trahit invitam nova vis, aliudque cupido,<br>mens aliud suadet: video meliora proboque,<br>deteriora sequor. quid in hospite, regia virgo,<br>ureris et thalamos alieni concipis orbis?</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="23">“Whether for life or death his numbered hours are in the mercy of the living Gods, and that he may not suffer risk of death, too well foreseen, now let my prayers prevail -- righteously uttered of a generous heart without the stress of love. What wicked thing has Jason done? His handsome person, youth, and noble ways, would move a heart of stone. Have I a heart of flint, or was I born a tigress to deny him timely aid?—Unless I interpose, he will be slain by the hot breath of brazen-footed bulls, or will be slaughtered by the warriors, sprung miraculous from earth, or will be given to satisfy the ravenous appetite of a huge dragon. Let my gloating eyes be satiate with his dying agonies! Let me incite the fury of these bulls! Stir to their blood-lust mad-born sons of Earth! Rouse up the never-sleeping dragon's rage!—Avert it Gods!—But why should I cry out upon the Gods to save him from such wrong, when, by my actions and my power, myself may shield him from all evils? Such a course would wreck the kingdom of my father—and by me the wily stranger would escape from him; and spreading to the wind his ready sails he would forget and leave me to my fate.—Oh, if he should forget my sacrifice, and so prefer those who neglected him, let him then perish in his treachery.—But these are idle thoughts: his countenance, reveals innate nobility and grace, that should dispel all fear of treachery, and guarantee his ever-faithful heart. The Gods will witness our united souls, and he shall pledge his faith. Secure of it my fear will be removed. Be ready, then—and make a virtue of necessity: your Jason owes himself to you; and he must join you in true wedlock. Then you shall be celebrated through the land of Greece, by throngs of women, for the man you saved. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">haec quoque terra potest, quod ames, dare. vivat an ille<br>occidat, in dis est. vivat tamen! idque precari<br>vel sine amore licet: quid enim commisit Iason?<br>quem, nisi crudelem, non tangat Iasonis aetas<br>et genus et virtus? quem non, ut cetera desint,<br>ore movere potest? certe mea pectora movit.<br>at nisi opem tulero, taurorum adflabitur ore<br>concurretque suae segeti, tellure creatis<br>hostibus, aut avido dabitur fera praeda draconi.<br>hoc ego si patiar, tum me de tigride natam,<br>tum ferrum et scopulos gestare in corde fatebor!<br>cur non et specto pereuntem oculosque videndo<br>conscelero? cur non tauros exhortor in illum<br>terrigenasque feros insopitumque draconem?<br>di meliora velint! quamquam non ista precanda,<br>sed facienda mihi.--prodamne ego regna parentis,<br>atque ope nescio quis servabitur advena nostra,<br>ut per me sospes sine me det lintea ventis<br>virque sit alterius, poenae Medea relinquar?<br>si facere hoc aliamve potest praeponere nobis,<br>occidat ingratus! sed non is vultus in illo,<br>non ea nobilitas animo est, ea gratia formae,<br>ut timeam fraudem meritique oblivia nostri.<br>et dabit ante fidem, cogamque in foedera testes<br>esse deos. quid tuta times? accingere et omnem<br>pelle moram: tibi se semper debebit Iason,<br>te face sollemni iunget sibi perque Pelasgas<br>servatrix urbes matrum celebrabere turba.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="51">“Shall I then sail away, and so forsake my sister, brother, father, Gods, and land that gave me birth? My father is indeed a stern man, and my native land is all too barbarous; my brother is a child,—my sister's goodwill is good help for me; and heaven's supreme god is within my breast. I shall not so be leaving valued hopes, but will be going surely to great things. And I should gain applause from all the world, as having saved the threatened Argonauts, most noble of the Greeks; and in their land, which certainly is better than my own, become the bride of Jason, for whose love I should not hesitate to give the world—and in whose love the living Gods rejoice so greatly; for his sake they would bestow their favors on my head, and make the stars my habitation. Should I hesitate because the wreck-strewn mountains bar the way, and clash together in the Euxine waves; or fear Charybdis, fatal to large ships, that sucks the deep sea in its whirling gulf and spouts far upward, with alternate force, or Scylla, circled with infuriate hounds howling in rage from deep Sicilian waves? Safe in the shielding arms of him I love, on Jason's bosom leaning, I shall be borne safely over wide and hostile seas; and in his dear embrace forget my fears—or if for anything I suffer dread, it will be only for the one I love.—Alas, Medea, this vain argument has only furnished plausible excuse for criminal desires, and desecrates the marriage rite. It is a wicked thing to think upon. Before it is too late forget your passion and deny this guilt.” And after she had said these words, her eyes were opened to the prize of modesty, chaste virtue, and a pure affection: and Cupid, vanquished, turned away and fled. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ergo ego germanam fratremque patremque deosque<br>et natale solum ventis ablata relinquam?<br>nempe pater saevus, nempe est mea barbara tellus,<br>frater adhuc infans; stant mecum vota sororis,<br>maximus intra me deus est! non magna relinquam,<br>magna sequar: titulum servatae pubis Achivae<br>notitiamque soli melioris et oppida, quorum<br>hic quoque fama viget, cultusque artesque locorum,<br>quemque ego cum rebus, quas totus possidet orbis,<br>Aesoniden mutasse velim, quo coniuge felix<br>et dis cara ferar et vertice sidera tangam.<br>quid, quod nescio qui mediis concurrere in undis<br>dicuntur montes ratibusque inimica Charybdis<br>nunc sorbere fretum, nunc reddere, cinctaque saevis<br>Scylla rapax canibus Siculo latrare profundo?<br>nempe tenens, quod amo, gremioque in Iasonis haerens<br>per freta longa ferar; nihil illum amplexa verebor<br>aut, siquid metuam, metuam de coniuge solo.--<br>coniugiumne putas speciosaque nomina culpae<br>inponis, Medea, tuae?--quin adspice, quantum<br>adgrediare nefas, et, dum licet, effuge crimen!'<br>dixit, et ante oculos rectum pietasque pudorque<br>constiterant, et victa dabat iam terga Cupido.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="74">Then, to an ancient altar of the goddess named Hecate, Perse's daughter took her way in the deep shadows of a forest. She was strong of purpose now, and all the flames of vanquished passion had died down; but when she saw the son of Aeson, dying flames leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all her face went pale again; as a small spark when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by a breath of wind grows and regains its strength, as it is fanned to life; so now her love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once more. For on that day his graceful person seemed as glorious as a God;—and as she gazed, and fixed her eyes upon his countenance, her frenzy so prevailed, she was convinced that he was not a mortal. And her eyes were fascinated; and she could not turn away from him. But when he spoke to her, and promised marriage, grasping her right hand: she answered, as her eyes suffused with tears; “I see what I will do, and ignorance of truth will not be my undoing now, but love itself. By my assistance you shall be preserved; but when preserved fulfill your promise.” He swore that she could trust in him. Then by the goddess of the triple form, Diana, Trivia, or Luna called, and by her sacred groves and fanes, he vowed, and by the hallowed Sun that sees all things, and by his own adventures, and his life,—on these the youthful Jason took his oath.—With this she was assured and quickly gave to him the magic herbs: he learnt their use and full of joy withdrew into his house. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ibat ad antiquas Hecates Perseidos aras,<br>quas nemus umbrosum secretaque silva tegebat,<br>et iam fortis erat, pulsusque recesserat ardor,<br>cum videt Aesoniden exstinctaque flamma reluxit.<br>erubuere genae, totoque recanduit ore,<br>utque solet ventis alimenta adsumere, quaeque<br>parva sub inducta latuit scintilla favilla<br>crescere et in veteres agitata resurgere vires,<br>sic iam lenis amor, iam quem languere putares,<br>ut vidit iuvenem, specie praesentis inarsit.<br>et casu solito formosior Aesone natus<br>illa luce fuit: posses ignoscere amanti.<br>spectat et in vultu veluti tum denique viso<br>lumina fixa tenet nec se mortalia demens<br>ora videre putat nec se declinat ab illo;<br>ut vero coepitque loqui dextramque prehendit<br>hospes et auxilium submissa voce rogavit<br>promisitque torum, lacrimis ait illa profusis:<br>'quid faciam, video: nec me ignorantia veri<br>decipiet, sed amor. servabere munere nostro,<br>servatus promissa dato!' per sacra triformis<br>ille deae lucoque foret quod numen in illo<br>perque patrem soceri cernentem cuncta futuri<br>eventusque suos et tanta pericula iurat:<br>creditus accepit cantatas protinus herbas<br>edidicitque usum laetusque in tecta recessit.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="100">Now when the dawn had dimmed the glittering stars, the people hastened to the sacred field of Mars, and on the hills expectant stood.—Arrayed in purple, and in majesty distinguished by his ivory sceptre, sat the king, surrounded by a multitude. Below them on the visioned Field of Mars, huge brazen-footed bulls were breathing forth from adamantine nostrils living flames, blasting the verdant herbage in their path! As forges glowing with hot flames resound, or as much quick-lime, burnt in earthen kilns, crackles and hisses as if mad with rage, sprinkled with water, liberating heat; so their hot throats and triple-heated sides, resounding told of pent-up fires within. The son of Aeson went to meet them. As he came to meet them the fierce animals turned on him faces terrible, and sharp horns tipped with iron, and they pawed the dusty earth with cloven feet, and filled the place with fiery bellowings. The Minyans were stark with fear; he went up to the bulls not feeling their hot breath at all, so great the power of his charmed drugs; and while he was stroking their down-hanging dewlaps with a fearless hand, he placed the yoke down on their necks and made them draw the heavy plow, and cut through fields that never felt the steel before. The Colchians were amazed and silent; but the loud shouting of the Minyans increased their hero's courage. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postera depulerat stellas Aurora micantes:<br>conveniunt populi sacrum Mavortis in arvum<br>consistuntque iugis; medio rex ipse resedit<br>agmine purpureus sceptroque insignis eburno.<br>ecce adamanteis Vulcanum naribus efflant<br>aeripedes tauri, tactaeque vaporibus herbae<br>ardent, utque solent pleni resonare camini,<br>aut ubi terrena silices fornace soluti<br>concipiunt ignem liquidarum adspergine aquarum,<br>pectora sic intus clausas volventia flammas<br>gutturaque usta sonant; tamen illis Aesone natus<br>obvius it. vertere truces venientis ad ora<br>terribiles vultus praefixaque cornua ferro<br>pulvereumque solum pede pulsavere bisulco<br>fumificisque locum mugitibus inpleverunt.<br>deriguere metu Minyae; subit ille nec ignes<br>sentit anhelatos (tantum medicamina possunt!)<br>pendulaque audaci mulcet palearia dextra<br>suppositosque iugo pondus grave cogit aratri<br>ducere et insuetum ferro proscindere campum:<br>mirantur Colchi, Minyae clamoribus augent<br>adiciuntque animos.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="121">Taking then the serpent's teeth out of a brazen helmet he sowed them broadcast in the new-plowed field. The moist earth softened these seeds that were steeped in virulent poison and the teeth swelled up and took new forms. And just as in its mother an infant gradually assumes the form of man, and is perfected through all parts within, and does not come forth to the light till fully formed; so, when the forms of men had been completed in the womb of earth made pregnant, they rose up from it, and what is yet more wonderful, each one clashed weapons that had been brought forth with him. When his companions saw the warriors turn as if with one accord, to hurl their spears, sharp-pointed, at the head of Jason, fear unnerved the boldest and their courage failed. So, too, the maid whose sorcery had saved him from much danger, when she saw the youth encompassed by those raging enemies, and he alone against so many—struck with sudden panic, she turned ashen white, her bloodless cheeks were blanched; and chilled with fear she wilted to the ground; and lest the herbs, so lately given him, might fail his need she added incantations and invoked mysterious arts. While she protected him he seized upon a heavy stone, and hurled it in the midst of his new enemies—distracted by this cast, and murderous, they turned from him, and clashing their new arms, those earth-born brothers fought among themselves till all were slaughtered in blood-thirsty strife. Gladly the Greeks acclaimed him conqueror, and pressed around him for the first embrace. Then, too, Medea, barbarous Colchian maid, although her modesty restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but careful of her good name, held aloof,—rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift of incantations. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">galea tum sumit aena<br>vipereos dentes et aratos spargit in agros.<br>semina mollit humus valido praetincta veneno,<br>et crescunt fiuntque sati nova corpora dentes,<br>utque hominis speciem materna sumit in alvo<br>perque suos intus numeros conponitur infans<br>nec nisi maturus communes exit in auras,<br>sic, ubi visceribus gravidae telluris imago<br>effecta est hominis, feto consurgit in arvo,<br>quodque magis mirum est, simul edita concutit arma.<br>quos ubi viderunt praeacutae cuspidis hastas<br>in caput Haemonii iuvenis torquere parantis,<br>demisere metu vultumque animumque Pelasgi;<br>ipsa quoque extimuit, quae tutum fecerat illum.<br>utque peti vidit iuvenem tot ab hostibus unum,<br>palluit et subito sine sanguine frigida sedit,<br>neve parum valeant a se data gramina, carmen<br>auxiliare canit secretasque advocat artes.<br>ille gravem medios silicem iaculatus in hostes<br>a se depulsum Martem convertit in ipsos:<br>terrigenae pereunt per mutua vulnera fratres<br>civilique cadunt acie. gratantur Achivi<br>victoremque tenent avidisque amplexibus haerent.<br>tu quoque victorem conplecti, barbara, velles:<br>obstitit incepto pudor, at conplexa fuisses,<br>sed te, ne faceres, tenuit reverentia famae.<br>quod licet, adfectu tacito laetaris agisque<br>carminibus grates et dis auctoribus horum.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="149">But the dragon, still alert,—magnificent and terrible with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs barbed as a javelin, guards the Golden Fleece: and Jason can obtain that quest only if slumber may seal up the monster's eyes.—Jason, successful, sprinkled on his crest Lethean juices of a magic herb, and then recited thrice the words which bring deep slumber, potent words which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean, and would stop the flow of the most rapid rivers of our earth: and slowly slumber sealed the dragon's eyes. While that great monster slept, the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid, (whose aid had saved him) to his native port Iolcus—victorious with the Argonauts. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Pervigilem superest herbis sopire draconem,<br>qui crista linguisque tribus praesignis et uncis<br>dentibus horrendus custos erat arboris aureae.<br>hunc postquam sparsit Lethaei gramine suci<br>verbaque ter dixit placidos facientia somnos,<br>quae mare turbatum, quae concita flumina sistunt,<br>somnus in ignotos oculos sibi venit, et auro<br>heros Aesonius potitur spolioque superbus<br>muneris auctorem secum, spolia altera, portans<br>victor Iolciacos tetigit cum coniuge portus.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Rejuvenation of Aeson</h4><ol><ruby value="159">Now when the valiant Argonauts returned to Thessaly, their happy relatives, fathers and mothers, praised the living Gods; and with their hallowed gifts enhanced the flames with precious incense; and they offered Jove a sacred bullock, rich with gilded horns. But Jason's father, Aeson, came not down rejoicing to behold his son, for now worn out with many years, he waited death. And Jason to Medea grieving said: “Dearest, to whom my life and love are due, although your kindness has been great to me, and you have granted more than I should ask, yet one thing more I beg of you; if your enchantments can accomplish my desire, take from my life some years that I should live and add them to my father's ending days.”—And as he spoke he could not check his tears. Medea, moved by his affection, thought how much less she had grieved for her loved sire: and she replied:—“A wicked thing you ask! Can I be capable of using you in such a manner as to take your life and give it to another? Ask not me a thing so dreadful! May the Gods forbid! -- I will endeavor to perform for you a task much greater. By the powers of Night I will most certainly return to him the lost years of your father, but must not deprive you of your own.—Oh grant the power, great goddess of the triple form, that I may fail not to accomplish this great deed!” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haemoniae matres pro gnatis dona receptis<br>grandaevique ferunt patres congestaque flamma<br>tura liquefaciunt, inductaque cornibus aurum<br>victima vota cadit, sed abest gratantibus Aeson<br>iam propior leto fessusque senilibus annis,<br>cum sic Aesonides: 'o cui debere salutem<br>confiteor, coniunx, quamquam mihi cuncta dedisti<br>excessitque fidem meritorum summa tuorum,<br>si tamen hoc possunt (quid enim non carmina possunt?)<br>deme meis annis et demptos adde parenti!'<br>nec tenuit lacrimas: mota est pietate rogantis,<br>dissimilemque animum subiit Aeeta relictus;<br>nec tamen adfectus talis confessa 'quod' inquit<br>'excidit ore tuo, coniunx, scelus? ergo ego cuiquam<br>posse tuae videor spatium transcribere vitae?<br>nec sinat hoc Hecate, nec tu petis aequa; sed isto,<br>quod petis, experiar maius dare munus, Iason.<br>arte mea soceri longum temptabimus aevum,<br>non annis revocare tuis, modo diva triformis<br>adiuvet et praesens ingentibus adnuat ausis.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="179">Three nights were wanting for the moon to join her circling horns and form a perfect orb. When these were passed, the rounded light shone full and bright upon the earth.—Through the still night alone, Medea stole forth from the house with feet bare, and in flowing garment clothed—her long hair unadorned and not confined. Deep slumber has relaxed the world, and all that's living, animals and birds and men, and even the hedges and the breathing leaves are still—and motionless the laden air. Only the stars are twinkling, and to them she looks and beckons with imploring hands. Now thrice around she paces, and three times besprinkles her long hair with water dipt from crystal streams, which having done she kneels a moment on the cold, bare ground, and screaming three times calls upon the Night,— <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tres aberant noctes, ut cornua tota coirent<br>efficerentque orbem; postquam plenissima fulsit<br>ac solida terras spectavit imagine luna,<br>egreditur tectis vestes induta recinctas,<br>nuda pedem, nudos umeris infusa capillos,<br>fertque vagos mediae per muta silentia noctis<br>incomitata gradus: homines volucresque ferasque<br>solverat alta quies, nullo cum murmure saepes,<br>inmotaeque silent frondes, silet umidus aer,<br>sidera sola micant: ad quae sua bracchia tendens<br>ter se convertit, ter sumptis flumine crinem<br>inroravit aquis ternisque ululatibus ora<br>solvit et in dura submisso poplite terra</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="192">“O faithful Night, regard my mysteries!

O fruitful Earth, giver of potent herbs! O gentle Breezes and destructive Winds! You Mountains, Rivers, Lakes and sacred Groves, and every dreaded god of silent Night! Attend upon me!—When my power commands, the rivers turn from their accustomed ways and roll far backward to their secret springs! I speak--and the wild, troubled sea is calm, and I command the waters to arise! The clouds I scatter—and I bring the clouds; I smooth the winds and ruffle up their rage; I weave my spells and I recite my charms; I pluck the fangs of serpents, and I move the living rocks and twist the rooted oaks; I blast the forests. Mountains at my word tremble and quake; and from her granite tombs the liberated ghosts arise as Earth astonished groans! From your appointed ways, O wonder-working Moon, I draw you down against the magic-making sound of gongs and brazen vessels of Temesa's ore; I cast my spells and veil the jeweled rays of Phoebus' wain, and quench Aurora's fires. At my command you tamed the flaming bulls which long disdained to bend beneath the yoke, until they pressed their necks against the plows; and, subject to my will, you raised up war till the strong company of dragon-birth were slaughtered as they fought amongst themselves; and, last, you lulled asleep the warden's eyes -- guards of the Golden Fleece—till then awake and sleeping never—so, deceiving him, you sent the treasure to the Grecian cities! Witness my need of super-natured herbs, elixirs potent to renew the years of age, giving the bloom of youth.—You shall not fail to grant me this; for not in vain the stars are flashing confirmation; not in vain the flying dragons, harnessed by their necks, from skies descending bring my chariot down.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Nox' ait 'arcanis fidissima, quaeque diurnis<br>aurea cum luna succeditis ignibus astra,<br>tuque, triceps Hecate, quae coeptis conscia nostris<br>adiutrixque venis cantusque artisque magorum,<br>quaeque magos, Tellus, pollentibus instruis herbis,<br>auraeque et venti montesque amnesque lacusque,<br>dique omnes nemorum, dique omnes noctis adeste,<br>quorum ope, cum volui, ripis mirantibus amnes<br>in fontes rediere suos, concussaque sisto,<br>stantia concutio cantu freta, nubila pello<br>nubilaque induco, ventos abigoque vocoque,<br>vipereas rumpo verbis et carmine fauces,<br>vivaque saxa sua convulsaque robora terra<br>et silvas moveo iubeoque tremescere montis<br>et mugire solum manesque exire sepulcris!<br>te quoque, Luna, traho, quamvis Temesaea labores<br>aera tuos minuant; currus quoque carmine nostro<br>pallet avi, pallet nostris Aurora venenis!<br>vos mihi taurorum flammas hebetastis et unco<br>inpatiens oneris collum pressistis aratro,<br>vos serpentigenis in se fera bella dedistis<br>custodemque rudem somni sopistis et aurum<br>vindice decepto Graias misistis in urbes:<br>nunc opus est sucis, per quos renovata senectus<br>in florem redeat primosque recolligat annos,<br>et dabitis. neque enim micuerunt sidera frustra,<br>nec frustra volucrum tractus cervice draconum<br>currus adest.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="219">A chariot, sent from heaven, came to her—and soon as she had stroked the dragons' necks, and shaken in her hands the guiding reins—as soon as she had mounted, she was borne quickly above, through unresisting air. And, sailing over Thessaly, she saw the vale of Tempe, where the level soil is widely covered with a crumbling chalk—she turned her dragons towards new regions there: and she observed the herbs by Ossa born, the weeds on lofty Pelion, Othrys, Pindus and vast Olympus -- and from here she plucked the needed roots, or there, the blossoms clipped all with a moon-curved sickle made of brass—many the wild weeds by Apidanus, as well as blue Amphrysus' banks, she chose, and not escaped Enipeus from her search; Peneian stretches and Spercheian banks all yielded what she chose:—and Boebe's shore where sway the rushes; and she plucked up grass, a secret grass, from fair Euboean fields life-giving virtues in their waving blades, as yet unknown for transformation wrought on Glaucus. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">aderat demissus ab aethere currus.<br>quo simul adscendit frenataque colla draconum<br>permulsit manibusque leves agitavit habenas,<br>sublimis rapitur subiectaque Thessala Tempe<br>despicit et certis regionibus adplicat angues:<br>et quas Ossa tulit, quas altum Pelion herbas,<br>Othrysque Pindusque et Pindo maior Olympus,<br>perspicit et placitas partim radice revellit,<br>partim succidit curvamine falcis aenae.<br>multa quoque Apidani placuerunt gramina ripis,<br>multa quoque Amphrysi, neque eras inmunis, Enipeu;<br>nec non Peneos nec non Spercheides undae<br>contribuere aliquid iuncosaque litora Boebes;<br>carpsit et Euboica vivax Anthedone gramen,<br>nondum mutato vulgatum corpore Glauci.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="234">All those fields she visited, with ceaseless diligence in quest of charms, nine days and nine nights sought strong herbs, and the swift dragons with their active wings, failed not to guide the chariot where she willed—until they reached her home. The dragons then had not been even touched by anything, except the odor of surrounding herbs, and yet they sloughed their skins, the growth of years. She would not cross the threshold of her home nor pass its gates; but, standing in the field, alone beneath the canopy of Heaven, she shunned all contact with her husband, while she built up from the ever-living turf two altars, one of which upon the right to Hecate was given, but the one upon the left was sacred then to you, O Hebe, goddess of eternal youth! Festooning woodland boughs and sweet vervain adorned these altars, near by which she dug as many trenches. Then, when all was done, she slaughtered a black ram, and sprinkled with blood the thirsty trenches; after which she poured from rich carchesian goblets generous wine and warm milk, grateful to propitious Gods—the Deities of earth on whom she called—entreating, as she did so, Pluto, lord of ghostly shades, and ravished Proserpine, that they should not, in undue haste, deprive her patient's aged limbs of life. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Et iam nona dies curru pennisque draconum<br>nonaque nox omnes lustrantem viderat agros,<br>cum rediit; neque erant tacti nisi odore dracones,<br>et tamen annosae pellem posuere senectae.<br>constitit adveniens citra limenque foresque<br>et tantum caelo tegitur refugitque viriles<br>contactus, statuitque aras de caespite binas,<br>dexteriore Hecates, ast laeva parte Iuventae.<br>has ubi verbenis silvaque incinxit agresti,<br>haud procul egesta scrobibus tellure duabus<br>sacra facit cultrosque in guttura velleris atri<br>conicit et patulas perfundit sanguine fossas;<br>tum super invergens liquidi carchesia mellis<br>alteraque invergens tepidi carchesia lactis,<br>verba simul fudit terrenaque numina civit<br>umbrarumque rogat rapta cum coniuge regem,<br>ne properent artus anima fraudare senili.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="251">When certain she compelled the God's regard, assured her incantations and long prayers were both approved and heard, she bade her people bring out the body of her father-in-law—old Aeson's worn out body—and when she had buried him in a deep slumber by her spells, as if he were a dead man, she then stretched him out upon a bed of herbs. She ordered Jason and his servants thence, and warned them not to spy upon her rites, with eyes profane. As soon as they retired, Medea, with disheveled hair and wild abandon, as a Bacchanalian, paced times three around the blazing altars, while she dipped her torches, splintered at the top, into the trenches, dark: with blood, and lit the dipt ends in the sacred altar flames. Times three she purified the ancient man with flames, and thrice with water, and three times with sulphur,—as the boiling mixture seethed and bubbled in the brazen cauldron near. And into this, acerbic juices, roots, and flowers and seeds—from vales Hemonian—and mixed elixirs, into which she cast stones of strange virtue from the Orient, and sifted sands of ebbing ocean's tide; white hoar-frost, gathered when the moon was full, the nauseating flesh and luckless wings of the uncanny screech-owl, and the entrails from a mysterious animal that changed from wolf to man, from man to wolf again; the scaly sloughing of a water-snake, the medic liver of a long-lived stag, and the hard beak and head of an old crow which was alive nine centuries before; these, and a thousand nameless things the foreign sorceress prepared and mixed, and blended all together with a branch of peaceful olive, old and dry with years.—And while she stirred the withered olive branch in the hot mixture, it began to change from brown to green; and presently put forth new leaves, and soon was heavy with a wealth of luscious olives.—As the ever-rising fire threw bubbling froth beyond the cauldron's rim, the ground was covered with fresh verdure—flowers and all luxuriant grasses, and green plants. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Quos ubi placavit precibusque et murmure longo,<br>Aesonis effetum proferri corpus ad auras<br>iussit et in plenos resolutum carmine somnos<br>exanimi similem stratis porrexit in herbis.<br>hinc procul Aesoniden, procul hinc iubet ire ministros<br>et monet arcanis oculos removere profanos.<br>diffugiunt iussi; passis Medea capillis<br>bacchantum ritu flagrantis circuit aras<br>multifidasque faces in fossa sanguinis atra<br>tinguit et infectas geminis accendit in aris<br>terque senem flamma, ter aqua, ter sulphure lustrat.<br>Interea validum posito medicamen aeno<br>fervet et exsultat spumisque tumentibus albet.<br>illic Haemonia radices valle resectas<br>seminaque floresque et sucos incoquit atros;<br>adicit extremo lapides Oriente petitos<br>et quas Oceani refluum mare lavit harenas;<br>addit et exceptas luna pernocte pruinas<br>et strigis infamis ipsis cum carnibus alas<br>inque virum soliti vultus mutare ferinos<br>ambigui prosecta lupi; nec defuit illis<br>squamea Cinyphii tenuis membrana chelydri<br>vivacisque iecur cervi; quibus insuper addit<br>ova caputque novem cornicis saecula passae.<br>his et mille aliis postquam sine nomine rebus<br>propositum instruxit mortali barbara maius,<br>arenti ramo iampridem mitis olivae<br>omnia confudit summisque inmiscuit ima.<br>ecce vetus calido versatus stipes aeno<br>fit viridis primo nec longo tempore frondes<br>induit et subito gravidis oneratur olivis:<br>at quacumque cavo spumas eiecit aeno<br>ignis et in terram guttae cecidere calentes,<br>vernat humus, floresque et mollia pabula surgunt.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="285">Medea, when she saw this wonder took her unsheathed knife and cut the old man's throat; then, letting all his old blood out of him she filled his ancient veins with rich elixir. As he received it through his lips or wound, his beard and hair no longer white with age, turned quickly to their natural vigor, dark and lustrous; and his wasted form renewed, appeared in all the vigor of bright youth, no longer lean and sallow, for new blood coursed in his well-filled veins.—Astonished, when released from his deep sleep, and strong in youth, his memory assured him, such he was years four times ten before that day!— <rtc lang="la" translate="no">quae simul ac vidit, stricto Medea recludit<br>ense senis iugulum veteremque exire cruorem<br>passa replet sucis; quos postquam conbibit Aeson<br>aut ore acceptos aut vulnere, barba comaeque<br>canitie posita nigrum rapuere colorem,<br>pulsa fugit macies, abeunt pallorque situsque,<br>adiectoque cavae supplentur corpore rugae,<br>membraque luxuriant: Aeson miratur et olim<br>ante quater denos hunc se reminiscitur annos.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="294">Bacchus, from his celestial vantage saw this marvel, and convinced his nurses might then all regain their former vigor, he pled with Medea to restore their youth.

There, since the king himself was heavy with old age, his daughters gave her generous reception. And these girls the shrewd Medea in a short time won, by her false show of friendliness; and while among the most remarkable of her achievements she was telling how she had rejuvenated Aeson, and she dwelt particularly, on that strange event, these daughters were induced to hope that by some skill like this their father might regain his lost youth also. And they begged of her this boon, persuading her to name the price; no matter if it was large. She did not reply at once and seemed to hesitate, and so she held their fond minds in a deep suspense by her feigned meditation. When she had at length declared she would restore his youth, she said to them: “That you may have strong confidence in this my promised boon, the oldest leader of your flock of sheep shall be changed to a lamb again by my prized drugs.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Neve doli cessent, odium cum coniuge falsum<br>Phasias adsimulat Peliaeque ad limina supplex<br>confugit; atque illam, quoniam gravis ipse senecta est,<br>excipiunt natae; quas tempore callida parvo<br>Colchis amicitiae mendacis imagine cepit,<br>dumque refert inter meritorum maxima demptos<br>Aesonis esse situs atque hac in parte moratur,<br>spes est virginibus Pelia subiecta creatis,<br>arte suum parili revirescere posse parentem,<br>idque petunt pretiumque iubent sine fine pacisci.<br>illa brevi spatio silet et dubitare videtur<br>suspenditque animos ficta gravitate rogantum.<br>mox ubi pollicita est, 'quo sit fiducia maior<br>muneris huius' ait, 'qui vestri maximus aevo est<br>dux gregis inter oves, agnus medicamine fiet.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="312">Straightway a wooly ram, worn out with length of untold years was brought, his great horns curved around his hollow temples. After she had cut his scrawny throat with her sharp knife Thessalian, barely staining it with his thin blood, Medea plunged his carcass in a bronze-made kettle, throwing in it at the same time juices of great potency. These made his body shrink and burnt away his two horns, and with horns his years. And now thin bleating was heard from within the pot; and even while they wondered at the sound, a lamb jumped out and frisking, ran away to find some udder with its needed milk. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">protinus innumeris effetus laniger annis<br>attrahitur flexo circum cava tempora cornu;<br>cuius ut Haemonio marcentia guttura cultro<br>fodit et exiguo maculavit sanguine ferrum,<br>membra simul pecudis validosque venefica sucos<br>mergit in aere cavo: minuunt ea corporis artus<br>cornuaque exurunt nec non cum cornibus annos,<br>et tener auditur medio balatus aeno:<br>nec mora, balatum mirantibus exsilit agnus<br>lascivitque fuga lactantiaque ubera quaerit.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="322">Amazed the daughters looked on and, now that these promises had been performed, they urged more eagerly their first request. Three times Phoebus unyoked his steeds after their plunge in Ebro's stream, and on the fourth night stars shown brilliant on the dark foil of the sky, and then the treacherous daughter of Aeetes set some clear water over a hot fire and put in it herbs of no potency. And now a death-like sleep held the king down, his body all relaxed, and with the king his guards, a sleep which incantations with the potency of magic words had given. The sad king's daughters, as they had been bid, were in his room, and with Medea stood around his bed. “Why do you hesitate,” Medea said. “You laggards, come and draw your swords; let out his old blood that I may refill his empty veins again with young blood. In your hands your father's life and youth are resting. You, his daughters, must have love for him, and if the hopes you have are not all vain, come, do your duty by your father; drive out old age at the point of your good weapons; and let out his blood enfeebled—cure him with the stroke of iron.” Spurred on by these words, as each one of them was filial she became the leader in the most unfilial act, and that she might not be most wicked did the wicked deed. Not one could bear to see her own blows, so they turned their eyes away; and every face averted so, they blindly struck him with their cruel hands. The old man streaming with his blood, still raised himself on elbow, and half mangled tried to get up from his bed; with all those swords around him, he stretched out his pale arms and he cried: “What will you do, my daughters? What has armed you to the death of your loved father?” Their wrong courage left them, and their hands fell. When he would have said still more, Medea cut his throat and plunged his mangled body into boiling water. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Obstipuere satae Pelia, promissaque postquam<br>exhibuere fidem, tum vero inpensius instant.<br>ter iuga Phoebus equis in Hibero flumine mersis<br>dempserat et quarta radiantia nocte micabant<br>sidera, cum rapido fallax Aeetias igni<br>imponit purum laticem et sine viribus herbas.<br>iamque neci similis resoluto corpore regem<br>et cum rege suo custodes somnus habebat,<br>quem dederant cantus magicaeque potentia linguae;<br>intrarant iussae cum Colchide limina natae<br>ambierantque torum: 'quid nunc dubitatis inertes?<br>stringite' ait 'gladios veteremque haurite crurorem,<br>ut repleam vacuas iuvenali sanguine venas!<br>in manibus vestris vita est aetasque parentis:<br>si pietas ulla est nec spes agitatis inanis,<br>officium praestate patri telisque senectam<br>exigite, et saniem coniecto emittite ferro!'<br>his, ut quaeque pia est, hortatibus inpia prima est<br>et, ne sit scelerata, facit scelus: haud tamen ictus<br>ulla suos spectare potest, oculosque reflectunt,<br>caecaque dant saevis aversae vulnera dextris.<br>ille cruore fluens, cubito tamen adlevat artus,<br>semilacerque toro temptat consurgere, et inter<br>tot medius gladios pallentia bracchia tendens<br>'quid facitis, gnatae? quid vos in fata parentis<br>armat?' ait: cecidere illis animique manusque;<br>plura locuturo cum verbis guttura Colchis<br>abstulit et calidis laniatum mersit in undis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="350">Only because her winged dragons sailed swiftly with her up to the lofty sky, escaped Medea punishment for this unheard of crime. Her chariot sailed above embowered Pelion—long the lofty home of Chiron—over Othrys, and the vale made famous where Cerambus met his fate. Cerambus, by the aid of nymphs, from there was wafted through the air on wings, when earth was covered by the overwhelming sea—and so escaped Deucalion's flood, uncrowned. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Quod nisi pennatis serpentibus isset in auras,<br>non exempta foret poenae: fugit alta superque<br>Pelion umbrosum, Philyreia tecta, superque<br>Othryn et eventu veteris loca nota Cerambi:<br>hic ope nympharum sublatus in aera pennis,<br>cum gravis infuso tellus foret obruta ponto,<br>Deucalioneas effugit inobrutus undas.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="357">She passed by Pittane upon the left, with its huge serpent-image of hard stone, and also passed the grove called Ida's, where the stolen bull was changed by Bacchus' power into a hunted stag—in that same vale Paris lies buried in the sand; and over fields where Mera warning harked, Medea flew; over the city of Eurypylus upon the Isle of Cos, whose women wore the horns of cattle when from there had gone the herd of Hercules; and over Rhodes beloved of Phoebus, where Telchinian tribes dwelt, whose bad eyes corrupting power shot forth;—Jove, utterly despising, thrust them deep beneath his brother's waves; over the walls of old Carthaea, where Alcidamas had seen with wonder a tame dove arise from his own daughter's body. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeoliam Pitanen a laeva parte relinquit<br>factaque de saxo longi simulacra draconis<br>Idaeumque nemus, quo nati furta, iuvencum,<br>occuluit Liber falsi sub imagine cervi,<br>quaque pater Corythi parva tumulatus harena est,<br>et quos Maera novo latratu terruit agros,<br>Eurypylique urbem, qua Coae cornua matres<br>gesserunt tum, cum discederet Herculis agmen,<br>Phoebeamque Rhodon et Ialysios Telchinas,<br>quorum oculos ipso vitiantes omnia visu<br>Iuppiter exosus fraternis subdidit undis;<br>transit et antiquae Cartheia moenia Ceae,<br>qua pater Alcidamas placidam de corpore natae<br>miraturus erat nasci potuisse columbam.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="371">And she saw the lakes of Hyrie in Teumesia's Vale, by swans frequented—There to satisfy his love for Cycnus, Phyllius gave two living vultures: shell for him subdued a lion, and delivered it to him; and mastered a great bull, at his command; but when the wearied Phyllius refused to render to his friend the valued bull. Indignant, the youth said, “You shall regret your hasty words;” which having said, he leaped from a high precipice, as if to death; but gliding through the air, on snow-white wings, was changed into a swan—Dissolved in tears, his mother Hyrie knew not he was saved; and weeping, formed the lake that bears her name. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">inde lacus Hyries videt et Cycneia Tempe,<br>quae subitus celebravit olor: nam Phylius illic<br>imperio pueri volucrisque ferumque leonem<br>tradiderat domitos; taurum quoque vincere iussus<br>vicerat et spreto totiens iratus amore<br>praemia poscenti taurum suprema negabat;<br>ille indignatus 'cupies dare' dixit et alto<br>desiluit saxo; cuncti cecidisse putabant:<br>factus olor niveis pendebat in aere pennis;<br>at genetrix Hyrie, servati nescia, flendo<br>delicuit stagnumque suo de nomine fecit.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="382">And over Pleuron, where on trembling wings escaped the mother Combe from her sons, Medea flew; and over the far isle Calauria, sacred to Latona.—She beheld the conscious fields whose lawful king, together with his queen were changed to birds. Upon her right Cyllene could be seen; there Menephon, degraded as a beast, outraged his mother. In the distance, she beheld Cephisius, who lamented long his hapless grandson, by Apollo changed into a bloated sea-calf. And she saw the house where king Eumelus mourned the death of his aspiring son.— <rtc lang="la" translate="no">adiacet his Pleuron, in qua trepidantibus alis<br>Ophias effugit natorum vulnera Combe;<br>inde Calaureae Letoidos adspicit arva<br>in volucrem versi cum coniuge conscia regis.<br>dextera Cyllene est, in qua cum matre Menephron<br>concubiturus erat saevarum more ferarum;<br>Cephison procul hinc deflentem fata nepotis<br>respicit in tumidam phocen ab Apolline versi<br>Eumelique domum lugentis in aere natum.</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Medea and Aegeus</h4><ol><ruby value="391">Borne on the wings of her enchanted dragons, she arrived at Corinth, whose inhabitants, 'tis said, from many mushrooms, watered by the rain sprang into being. There she spent some years. But after the new wife had been burnt by the Colchian witchcraft and two seas had seen the king's own palace all aflame, then, savagely she drew her sword, and bathed it in the blood of her own infant sons; by which atrocious act she was revenged; and she, a wife and mother, fled the sword of her own husband, Jason. On the wings of her enchanted Titan Dragons borne, she made escape, securely, nor delayed until she entered the defended walls of great Minerva's city, at the hour when aged Periphas—transformed by Jove, together with his queen, on eagle wings flew over its encircling walls: with whom the guilty Halcyone, skimming seas safely escaped, upon her balanced wings. And after these events, Medea went to Aegeus, king of Athens, where she found protection from her enemies for all this evil done. With added wickedness Aegeus, after that, united her to him in marriage.— <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tandem vipereis Ephyren Pirenida pennis<br>contigit: hic aevo veteres mortalia primo<br>corpora vulgarunt pluvialibus edita fungis.<br>sed postquam Colchis arsit nova nupta venenis<br>flagrantemque domum regis mare vidit utrumque,<br>sanguine natorum perfunditur inpius ensis,<br>ultaque se male mater Iasonis effugit arma.<br>hinc Titaniacis ablata draconibus intrat<br>Palladias arces, quae te, iustissima Phene,<br>teque, senex Peripha, pariter videre volantes<br>innixamque novis neptem Polypemonis alis.<br>excipit hanc Aegeus facto damnandus in uno,<br>nec satis hospitium est, thalami quoque foedere iungit.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="404">All unknown to him came Theseus to his kingly court.—Before the time his valor had established peace on all the isthmus, raved by dual seas. Medea, seeking his destruction, brewed the juice of aconite, infesting shores of Scythia, where, 'tis fabled, the plant grew on soil infected by Cerberian teeth. There is a gloomy entrance to a cave, that follows a declivitous descent: there Hercules with chains of adamant dragged from the dreary edge of Tartarus that monster-watch-dog, Cerberus, which, vain opposing, turned his eyes aslant from light—from dazzling day. Delirious, enraged, that monster shook the air with triple howls; and, frothing, sprinkled as it raved, the fields, once green—with spewing of white poison-foam. And this, converted into plants, sucked up a deadly venom with the nourishment of former soils, -- from which productive grew upon the rock, thus formed, the noxious plant; by rustics, from that cause, named aconite. Medea worked on Aegeus to present his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup of aconite; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy. Theseus unwittingly received the cup, but just before he touched it to his lips, his father recognized the sword he wore, for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device—the token of his race. Astonished, Aegeus struck the poison-cup from his devoted son's confiding lips. Medea suddenly escaped from death, in a dark whirlwind her witch-singing raised. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque aderat Theseus, proles ignara parenti,<br>qui virtute sua bimarem pacaverat Isthmon:<br>huius in exitium miscet Medea, quod olim<br>attulerat secum Scythicis aconiton ab oris.<br>illud Echidnaeae memorant e dentibus ortum<br>esse canis: specus est tenebroso caecus hiatu,<br>est via declivis, per quam Tirynthius heros<br>restantem contraque diem radiosque micantes<br>obliquantem oculos nexis adamante catenis<br>Cerberon abstraxit, rabida qui concitus ira<br>inplevit pariter ternis latratibus auras<br>et sparsit virides spumis albentibus agros;<br>has concresse putant nactasque alimenta feracis<br>fecundique soli vires cepisse nocendi;<br>quae quia nascuntur dura vivacia caute,<br>agrestes aconita vocant. ea coniugis astu<br>ipse parens Aegeus nato porrexit ut hosti.<br>sumpserat ignara Theseus data pocula dextra,<br>cum pater in capulo gladii cognovit eburno<br>signa sui generis facinusque excussit ab ore.<br>effugit illa necem nebulis per carmina motis;</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Aeacus and the Myrmidons</h4><ol><ruby value="425">Recoiling from such utter wickedness, rejoicing that his son escaped from death, the grateful father kindled altar-fires, and gave rich treasure to the living Gods.—He slaughtered scores of oxen, decked with flowers and gilded horns.

While the king Aegeus and his son rejoiced, Minos prepared for war. He was invincible in men and ships—and stronger in his rage to wreak due vengeance on the king who slew his son Androgeus. But first he sought some friends to aid his warfare; and he scoured the sea with a swift fleet -- which was his strength. Anaphe and Astypalaea, both agreed to join his cause—the first one moved by promises, the second by his threats. Level Myconus and the chalky fields of Cimolus agreed to aid, and Syros covered with wild thyme, level Seriphos, Paros of marble cliffs, and that place which Arne the impious Siphnian had betrayed, who having got the gold which in her greed she had demanded, was changed to a bird which ever since that day imagines gold its chief delight—a black-foot black-winged daw. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nec tamen (usque adeo nulla est sincera voluptas,<br>sollicitumque aliquid laetis intervenit) Aegeus<br>gaudia percepit nato secura recepto:<br>bella parat Minos; qui quamquam milite, quamquam<br>classe valet, patria tamen est firmissimus ira<br>Androgeique necem iustis ulciscitur armis.<br>ante tamen bello vires adquirit amicas,<br>quaque potens habitus volucri freta classe pererrat:<br>hinc Anaphen sibi iungit et Astypaleia regna,<br>(promissis Anaphen, regna Astypaleia bello);<br>hinc humilem Myconon cretosaque rura Cimoli<br>florentemque thymo Syron planamque Seriphon<br>marmoreamque Paron, quamque inpia prodidit Arne<br>Siphnon et accepto, quod avara poposcerat, auro<br>mutata est in avem, quae nunc quoque diligit aurum,<br>nigra pedes, nigris velata monedula pennis.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="469">But Oliarus, Didymae, and Tenos, Gyaros, Andros, and Peparethos rich in its glossy olives, gave no aid to the strong Cretan fleet. Sailing from them Minos went to Oenopia, known realm of the Aeacidae.—Men of old time had called the place Oenopia; but Aeacus styled it Aegina from his mother's name. At his approach an eager rabble rushed resolved to see and know so great a man. Telamon met him, and his brother, younger than Telamon, and Phocus who was third in age. Even Aeacus appeared, slow with the weight of years, and asked him what could be a reason for his coming there. The ruler of a hundred cities, sighed, as he beheld the sons of Aeacus, for they reminded him of his lost son;—and heavy with his sorrow, he replied: “I come imploring you to take up arms, and aid me in the war against my foes; for I must give that comfort to the shade of my misfortuned son -- whose blood they shed.” But Aeacus replied to Minos, “Nay, it is a vain request you make, for we are bound in strict alliance to the land and people of Cecropia.” Full of rage, because he was denied, the king of Crete, Minos, as he departed from their shores replied, “Let such a treaty be your bane.” And he departed with his crafty threat, believing it expedient not to waste his power in wars until the proper time. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At non Oliaros Didymeque et Tenos et Andros<br>et Gyaros nitidaeque ferax Peparethos olivae<br>Cnosiacas iuvere rates; latere inde sinistro<br>Oenopiam Minos petit, Aeacideia regna:<br>Oenopiam veteres adpellavere, sed ipse<br>Aeacus Aeginam genetricis nomine dixit.<br>turba ruit tantaeque virum cognoscere famae<br>expetit; occurrunt illi Telamonque minorque<br>quam Telamon Peleus et proles tertia Phocus;<br>ipse quoque egreditur tardus gravitate senili<br>Aeacus et, quae sit veniendi causa, requirit.<br>admonitus patrii luctus suspirat et illi<br>dicta refert rector populorum talia centum:<br>'arma iuves oro pro gnato sumpta piaeque<br>pars sis militiae; tumulo solacia posco.'<br>huic Asopiades 'petis inrita' dixit 'et urbi<br>non facienda meae; neque enim coniunctior ulla<br>Cecropidis est hac tellus: ea foedera nobis.'<br>tristis abit 'stabunt' que 'tibi tua foedera magno'<br>dixit et utilius bellum putat esse minari<br>quam gerere atque suas ibi praeconsumere vires.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="490">Before the ships of Crete had disappeared, before the mist and blue of waves concealed their fading outlines from the anxious throng which gathered on Oenopian shores, a ship of Athens covered with wide sails appeared, and anchored safely by their friendly shore; and, presently, the mighty Cephalus, well known through all that nation for his deeds, addressed them as he landed, and declared the good will of his people. Him the sons of Aeacus remembered well, although they had not seen him for some untold years. They led him to their father's welcome home; and with him, also, his two comrades went, Clytus and Butes. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">classis ab Oenopiis etiamnum Lyctia muris<br>spectari poterat, cum pleno concita velo<br>Attica puppis adest in portusque intrat amicos,<br>quae Cephalum patriaeque simul mandata ferebat.<br>Aeacidae longo iuvenes post tempore visum<br>agnovere tamen Cephalum dextrasque dedere<br>inque patris duxere domum: spectabilis heros<br>et veteris retinens etiamnum pignora formae<br>ingreditur ramumque tenens popularis olivae<br>a dextra laevaque duos aetate minores<br>maior habet, Clyton et Buten, Pallante creatos.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="501">Center of all eyes, the hero still retained his charm, the customary greetings were exchanged, the graceful hero, bearing in his hands a branch of olive from his native soil, delivered the Athenian message, which requested aid and offered for their thought the treaty and the ancestral league between their nations. And he added, Minos sought not only conquest of the Athenian state but sovereignty of all the states of Greece. And when this eloquence had shown his cause; with left hand on his gleaming sceptre's hilt, King Aeacus exclaimed: “Ask not our aid, but take it, Athens; and count boldly yours all of the force this island holds, and all things which the state of my affairs supplies. My strength for this war is not light, and I have many soldiers for myself and for my enemy. Thanks to the Gods! the times are happy, giving no excuse for my refusal.” “May it prove so,” Cephalus replied, “and may your city multiply in men: just now as I was landing, I rejoiced to meet youths, fair and matched in age. And yet I miss among them many whom I saw before when last I visited your city.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postquam congressus primi sua verba tulerunt,<br>Cecropidae Cephalus peragit mandata rogatque<br>auxilium foedusque refert et iura parentum,<br>imperiumque peti totius Achaidos addit.<br>sic ubi mandatam iuvit facundia causam,<br>Aeacus, in capulo sceptri nitente sinistra,<br>'ne petite auxilium, sed sumite' dixit, 'Athenae,<br>nec dubie vires, quas haec habet insula, vestras<br>ducite, et (o maneat rerum status iste mearum!)<br>robora non desunt; superat mihi miles et hoc est,<br>gratia dis, felix et inexcusabile tempus.'<br>'immo ita sit' Cephalus, 'crescat tua civibus opto<br>urbs' ait; 'adveniens equidem modo gaudia cepi,<br>cum tam pulchra mihi, tam par aetate iuventus<br>obvia processit; multos tamen inde requiro,<br>quos quondam vidi vestra prius urbe receptus.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="517">Aeacus then groaned and with sad voice replied: “With weeping we began, but better fortune followed. Would that I could tell the last of it, and not the first! Giving my heart command that simple words and briefly spoken may not long detain. Those happy youths who waited at your need, who smiled upon you and for whom you ask, because their absence grieves your noble mind, they've perished! and their bleaching bones or scattered ashes, only may remain, sad remnants, impotent, of vanished power, so recently my hope and my resource. Because this island bears a rival's name, a deadly pestilence was visited on my confiding people, through the rage of jealous Juno flaming for revenge. This great calamity at first appeared a natural disease—but soon its power baffled our utmost efforts. Medicines availing not, a reign of terror swept from shore to shore and fearful havoc raged. Thick darkness, gathered from descending skies, enveloped our devoted land with heat and languid sickness, for the space of full four moons.—Four times the Moon increased her size. Hot south winds blew with pestilential breath upon us. At the same time the diseased infection reached our needed springs and pools, thousands of serpents crawling over our deserted fields, defiled our rivers with their poison. The swift power of the disease at first was limited to death of dogs and birds and cattle, or among wild beasts. The luckless plowman marvels when he sees his strong bulls fall while at their task and sink down in the furrow. Woolly flocks bleat feebly while their wool falls off without a cause, and while their bodies pine away. The prized horse of high courage, and of great renown when on the race-course, has now lost victorious spirit, and forgetting his remembered glory groans in his shut stall, doomed for inglorious death. The boar forgets to rage, the stag to trust his speed; and even the famished bear to fight the stronger herd. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeacus ingemuit tristique ita voce locutus:<br>'flebile principium melior fortuna secuta est;<br>hanc utinam possem vobis memorare sine illo!<br>ordine nunc repetam, neu longa ambage morer vos,<br>ossa cinisque iacent, memori quos mente requiris,<br>et quota pars illi rerum periere mearum!<br>dira lues ira populis Iunonis iniquae<br>incidit exosae dictas a paelice terras.<br>dum visum mortale malum tantaeque latebat<br>causa nocens cladis, pugnatum est arte medendi:<br>exitium superabat opem, quae victa iacebat.<br>principio caelum spissa caligine terras<br>pressit et ignavos inclusit nubibus aestus;<br>dumque quater iunctis explevit cornibus orbem<br>Luna, quater plenum tenuata retexuit orbem,<br>letiferis calidi spirarunt aestibus austri.<br>constat et in fontis vitium venisse lacusque,<br>miliaque incultos serpentum multa per agros<br>errasse atque suis fluvios temerasse venenis.<br>strage canum primo volucrumque oviumque boumque<br>inque feris subiti deprensa potentia morbi.<br>concidere infelix validos miratur arator<br>inter opus tauros medioque recumbere sulco;<br>lanigeris gregibus balatus dantibus aegros<br>sponte sua lanaeque cadunt et corpora tabent;<br>acer equus quondam magnaeque in pulvere famae<br>degenerat palmas veterumque oblitus honorum<br>ad praesepe gemit leto moriturus inerti.<br>non aper irasci meminit, non fidere cursu<br>cerva nec armentis incurrere fortibus ursi.<br>omnia languor habet: silvisque agrisque viisque<br>corpora foeda iacent, vitiantur odoribus aurae.<br>mira loquar: non illa canes avidaeque volucres,<br>non cani tetigere lupi; dilapsa liquescunt<br>adflatuque nocent et agunt contagia late.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="552">“Death seizes on the vitals of all life; and in the woods, and in the fields and roads the loathsome bodies of the dead corrupt the heavy-hanging air. Even the dogs, the vultures and the wolves refuse to touch the putrid flesh, there in the sultry sun rotting upon the earth; emitting steams, and exhalations, with a baneful sweep increasing the dread contagion's wide extent. So spreading, with renewed destruction gained from its own poison, the fierce pestilence appeared to leap from moulding carcases of all the brute creation, till it struck the wretched tillers of the soil, and then extended its dominion over all this mighty city. Always it began as if the patient's bowels were scorched with flames; red blotches on the body next appeared, and sharp pains in the lungs prevented breath. The swollen tongue would presently loll out, rough and discolored from the gaping mouth, wide-gasping to inhale the noxious air—and show red throbbing veins. The softest bed. And richest covering gave to none relief; but rather, the diseased would bare himself to cool his burning breast upon the ground, only to heat the earth—and no relief returned. And no physician could be found; for those who ministered among the sick were first to suffer from the dread disease—the cruel malady broke out upon the very ones who offered remedies. The hallowed art of medicine became a deadly snare to those who knew it best. The only safety was in flight; and those who were the nearest to the stricken ones, and who most faithfully observed their wants, were always first to suffer as their wards. And many, certain of approaching death, indulged their wicked passions—recklessly abandoned and without the sense of shame, promiscuously huddled by the wells, and rivers and cool fountains; but their thirst no water could assuage, and death alone was able to extinguish their desire. Too weak to rise, they die in water they pollute, while others drink its death. A madness seizing on them made their beds become most irksome to their tortured nerves. Demented they could not endure the pain, and leaped insanely forth. Or if too weak, the wretches rolled their bodies on the ground, insistent to escape from hated homes—imagined sources of calamity; for, since the cause was hidden and unknown, the horrible locality was blamed. Suspicion seizes on each frail presence as proof of what can never be resolved. And many half-dead wretches staggered out on sultry roads as long as they could stand; and others weeping, stretched out on the ground, died in convulsions, as their rolling eyes gazed upwards at the overhanging clouds; under the sad stars they breathed out their souls. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Pervenit ad miseros damno graviore colonos<br>pestis et in magnae dominatur moenibus urbis.<br>viscera torrentur primo, flammaeque latentis<br>indicium rubor est et ductus anhelitus; igni<br>aspera lingua tumet, tepidisque arentia ventis<br>ora patent, auraeque graves captantur hiatu.<br>non stratum, non ulla pati velamina possunt,<br>nuda sed in terra ponunt praecordia, nec fit<br>corpus humo gelidum, sed humus de corpore fervet.<br>nec moderator adest, inque ipsos saeva medentes<br>erumpit clades, obsuntque auctoribus artes;<br>quo propior quisque est servitque fidelius aegro,<br>in partem leti citius venit, utque salutis<br>spes abiit finemque vident in funere morbi,<br>indulgent animis et nulla, quid utile, cura est:<br>utile enim nihil est. passim positoque pudore<br>fontibus et fluviis puteisque capacibus haerent,<br>nec sitis est exstincta prius quam vita bibendo.<br>inde graves multi nequeunt consurgere et ipsis<br>inmoriuntur aquis, aliquis tamen haurit et illas;<br>tantaque sunt miseris invisi taedia lecti,<br>prosiliunt aut, si prohibent consistere vires,<br>corpora devolvunt in humum fugiuntque penates<br>quisque suos, sua cuique domus funesta videtur,<br>et quia causa latet, locus est in crimine; partim<br>semianimes errare viis, dum stare valebant,<br>adspiceres, flentes alios terraque iacentes<br>lassaque versantes supremo lumina motu;<br>membraque pendentis tendunt ad sidera caeli,<br>hic illic, ubi mors deprenderat, exhalantes.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="582">“And oh, the deep despair that seized on me, the sovereign of that wretched people! I was tortured with a passionate desire to die the same death—And I hated life. No matter where my shrinking eyes were turned, I saw a multitude of gruesome forms in ghastly attitudes bestrew the ground, scattered as rotten apples that have dropped from moving branches, or as acorns thick around a gnarled oak. Lift up your eyes! Behold that holy temple! unto Jove long dedicated!—What availed the prayers of frightened multitudes, or incense burned on those devoted altars?—In the midst of his most fervent supplications, the husband as he pled for his dear wife, or the fond father for his stricken son, would suddenly, before a word prevailed, die clutching at the altars of his Gods, while holding in his stiffened hand, a spray of frankincense still waiting for the fire. How often sacrificial bulls have been brought to those temples, and while white-robed priest was pouring offered wine between their horns, have fallen without waiting for the stroke. While I prepared a sacrifice to Jove, for my behalf, my country and three sons, the victim, ever moaning dismal sounds, before a blow was struck, fell suddenly beside the altar; and his scanty blood ran thinly from the knives that slaughtered him. His entrails, wanting all the marks of truth were so diseased, the warnings of the Gods could not be read—the baneful malady had penetrated to the heart of life. And I have seen the carcases of men lie rotting at the sacred temple gates, or by the very altars, where they fell, making death odious to the living Gods. And often I have seen some desperate man end life by his own halter, and so cheat by voluntary death his fear of death, in mad haste to outrun approaching fate. The bodies of the dead, indecently were cast forth, lacking sacred funeral rites as hitherto the custom. All the gates were crowded with processions of the dead. Unburied, they might lie upon the ground, or else, deserted, on their lofty pyres with no one to lament their dismal end, dissolve in their dishonored ashes. All restraint forgotten, a mad rabble fought and took possession of the burning pyres, and even the dead were ravished of their rest.—And who should mourn them wanting, all the souls of sons and husbands, and of old and young, must wander unlamented: and the land sufficed not for the crowded sepulchers: and the dense forest was denuded of all trees. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Quid mihi tunc animi fuit? an, quod debuit esse,<br>ut vitam odissem et cuperem pars esse meorum?<br>quo se cumque acies oculorum flexerat, illic<br>vulgus erat stratum, veluti cum putria motis<br>poma cadunt ramis agitataque ilice glandes.<br>templa vides contra gradibus sublimia longis:<br>Iuppiter illa tenet. quis non altaribus illis<br>inrita tura dedit? quotiens pro coniuge coniunx,<br>pro gnato genitor dum verba precantia dicit,<br>non exoratis animam finivit in aris,<br>inque manu turis pars inconsumpta reperta est!<br>admoti quotiens templis, dum vota sacerdos<br>concipit et fundit durum inter cornua vinum,<br>haud exspectato ceciderunt vulnere tauri!<br>ipse ego sacra Iovi pro me patriaque tribusque<br>cum facerem natis, mugitus victima diros<br>edidit et subito conlapsa sine ictibus ullis<br>exiguo tinxit subiectos sanguine cultros.<br>exta quoque aegra notas veri monitusque deorum<br>perdiderant: tristes penetrant ad viscera morbi.<br>ante sacros vidi proiecta cadavera postes,<br>ante ipsas, quo mors foret invidiosior, aras.<br>pars animam laqueo claudunt mortisque timorem<br>morte fugant ultroque vocant venientia fata.<br>corpora missa neci nullis de more feruntur<br>funeribus (neque enim capiebant funera portae):<br>aut inhumata premunt terras aut dantur in altos<br>indotata rogos; et iam reverentia nulla est,<br>deque rogis pugnant alienisque ignibus ardent.<br>qui lacriment, desunt, indefletaeque vagantur<br>natorumque patrumque animae iuvenumque senumque,<br>nec locus in tumulos, nec sufficit arbor in ignes.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="614">“Heart-broken at the sight of this great woe, I wailed, `O Jupiter! if truth were told of your sweet comfort in Aegina's arms, if you were not ashamed of me, your son, restore my people, or entomb my corpse, that I may suffer as the ones I love.’—Great lightning flashed around me, and the sound of thunder proved that my complaint was heard.

And while I wondered at the endless line I said, `Good father, give me citizens of equal number for my empty walls.’ Soon as I said those words, though not a wind was moving nor a breeze,—the lofty tree began to tremble, and I heard a sound of motion in its branches. Wonder not that sudden fear possessed me; and my hair began to rise; and I could hardly stand for so my weak knees tottered!—As I made obeisance to the soil and sacred tree, perhaps I cherished in my heart a thought, that, not acknowledged, cheered me with some hope. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">forte fuit iuxta patulis rarissima ramis<br>sacra Iovi quercus de semine Dodonaeo;<br>hic nos frugilegas adspeximus agmine longo<br>grande onus exiguo formicas ore gerentes<br>rugosoque suum servantes cortice callem;<br>dum numerum miror, "totidem, pater optime," dixi,<br>"tu mihi da cives et inania moenia supple!"<br>intremuit ramisque sonum sine flamine motis<br>alta dedit quercus: pavido mihi membra timore<br>horruerant, stabantque comae; tamen oscula terrae<br>roboribusque dedi, nec me sperare fatebar;<br>sperabam tamen atque animo mea vota fovebam.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="634">“At night I lay exhausted by such thoughts, a deep sleep seized my body, but the tree seemed always present—to my gaze distinct with all its branches—I could even see the birds among its leaves; and from its boughs, that trembled in the still air, moving ants were scattered to the ground in troops below; and ever, as they touched the soil, they grew larger and larger.—As they raised themselves, they stood with upright bodies, and put off their lean shapes; and absorbed their many feet: and even as their dark brown color changed, their rounded forms took on a human shape. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">nox subit, et curis exercita corpora somnus<br>occupat: ante oculos eadem mihi quercus adesse<br>et ramis totidem totidemque animalia ramis<br>ferre suis visa est pariterque tremescere motu<br>graniferumque agmen subiectis spargere in arvis;<br>crescere desubito et maius maiusque videri<br>ac se tollere humo rectoque adsistere trunco<br>et maciem numerumque pedum nigrumque colorem<br>ponere et humanam membris inducere formam.<br>somnus abit: damno vigilans mea visa querorque<br>in superis opis esse nihil; at in aedibus ingens<br>murmur erat, vocesque hominum exaudire videbar<br>iam mihi desuetas;</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="646">“When my strange dream departed, I awoke, the vision vanished, I complained to Heaven against the idle comfort of such dreams; but as I voiced my own lament, I heard a mighty murmur echoing through the halls of my deserted palace, and a multitude of voices in confusion; where the sound of scarce an echo had disturbed the still deserted chambers for so many days. All this I thought the fancy of my dream, until my brave son Telamon, in haste threw open the closed doorway, as he called, `Come quickly father, and behold a sight beyond the utmost of your fondest dreams!’ I did go out, and there I saw such men each in his turn, as I had seen transformed in that weird vision of the moving ants. They all advanced, and hailed me as their king. So soon as I had offered vows to Jove, I subdivided the deserted farms, and dwellings in the cities to these men miraculously raised—which now are called my Myrmidons,—the living evidence of my strange vision. You have seen these men; and since that day, their name has been declared, `Decisive evidence.’ They have retained the well-known customs of the days before their transformation. Patiently they toil; they store the profits of their labor; which they guard with valiant skill. They'll follow you to any war, well matched in years and courage, and I do promise, when this east wind turns, this wind that favored you and brought you here, and when a south wind favors our design, then my brave Myrmidons will go with you.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">dum suspicor has quoque somni<br>esse, venit Telamon properus foribusque reclusis<br>"speque fideque, pater", dixit "maiora videbis:<br>egredere!" egredior, qualesque in imagine somni<br>visus eram vidisse viros, ex ordine tales<br>adspicio noscoque: adeunt regemque salutant.<br>vota Iovi solvo populisque recentibus urbem<br>partior et vacuos priscis cultoribus agros,<br>Myrmidonasque voco nec origine nomina fraudo.<br>corpora vidisti; mores, quos ante gerebant,<br>nunc quoque habent: parcum genus est patiensque laborum<br>quaesitique tenax et quod quaesita reservet.<br>hi te ad bella pares annis animisque sequentur,<br>cum primum qui te feliciter attulit eurus'<br>(eurus enim attulerat) 'fuerit mutatus in austrum.'</rtc></ruby></ol><h4>Cephalus and Procris</h4><ol><ruby value="661">This narrative and many other tales had occupied the day. As twilight fell, festivities were blended in the night—the night, in turn, afforded sweet repose. Soon as the golden Sun had shown his light, the east wind blowing still, the ships were stayed from sailing home. The sons of Pallas came to Cephalus, who was the elder called; and Cephalus together with the sons of Pallas, went to see the king. Deep sleep still held the king; and Phocus who was son of Aeacus, received them at the gate, instead of Telamon and Peleus who were marshalling the men for war. Into the inner court and beautiful apartments Phocus conducted the Athenians, and they sat down together. Phocus then observed that Cephalus held in his hand a curious javelin with golden head, and shaft of some rare wood. And as they talked, he said; “It is my pleasure to explore the forest in the chase of startled game, and so I've learned the nature of rare woods, but never have I seen the match of this from which was fashioned this good javelin; it lacks the yellow tint of forest ash, it is not knotted like all corner-wood; although I cannot name the kind of wood, my eyes have never seen a javelin-shaft so beautiful as this.” To him replied a friend of Cephalus; “But you will find its beauty is not equal to its worth, for whatsoever it is aimed against, its flight is always certain to the mark, nor is it subject to the shift of chance; and after it has struck, although no hand may cast it back, it certainly returns, bloodstained with every victim.” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talibus atque aliis longum sermonibus illi<br>inplevere diem; lucis pars ultima mensae<br>est data, nox somnis. iubar aureus extulerat Sol,<br>flabat adhuc eurus redituraque vela tenebat:<br>ad Cephalum Pallante sati, cui grandior aetas,<br>ad regem Cephalus simul et Pallante creati<br>conveniunt, sed adhuc regem sopor altus habebat.<br>excipit Aeacides illos in limine Phocus;<br>nam Telamon fraterque viros ad bella legebant.<br>Phocus in interius spatium pulchrosque recessus<br>Cecropidas ducit, cum quis simul ipse resedit.<br>adspicit Aeoliden ignota ex arbore factum<br>ferre manu iaculum, cuius fuit aurea cuspis.<br>pauca prius mediis sermonibus ille locutus<br>'sum nemorum studiosus' ait 'caedisque ferinae;<br>qua tamen e silva teneas hastile recisum,<br>iamdudum dubito: certe si fraxinus esset,<br>fulva colore foret; si cornus, nodus inesset.<br>unde sit, ignoro, sed non formosius isto<br>viderunt oculi telum iaculabile nostri.'<br>excipit Actaeis e fratribus alter et 'usum<br>maiorem specie mirabere' dixit 'in isto.<br>consequitur, quodcumque petit, fortunaque missum<br>non regit, et revolat nullo referente cruentum.'</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="685">Then indeed, was Phocus anxious to be told, whence came and who had given such a precious gift. And Cephalus appeared to tell him all; but craftily was silent on one strange condition of the fatal gift. As he recalled the mournful fate of his dear wife, his eyes filled up with tears. “Ah, pity me,” he said, “If Fate should grant me many years, I must weep every time that I regard this weapon which has been my cause of tears; the unforgiven death of my dear wife—ah, would that I had never handled it! My sweet wife, Procris!—if you could compare her beauty with her sister's—Orithyia's, (ravished by the blustering Boreas) you would declare my wife more beautiful. 'Tis she her sire Erectheus joined to me, 'Tis she the god Love also joined to me. They called me happy, and in truth I was, and all pronounced us so until the Gods decreed it otherwise. Two joyful months of our united love were almost passed, when, as the grey light of the dawn dispelled, upon the summit of Hymettus green, Aurora, glorious in her golden robes, observed me busy with encircling nets, trapping the antlered deer. Against my will incited by desire, she carried me away with her. Oh, let me not increase her anger, for I tell you what is true, I found no comfort in her lovely face! And, though she is the very queen of light, and reigns upon the edge of shadowy space where she is nourished on rich nectar-wine, adding delight to beauty, I could give no heed to her entreaties, for the thought of my beloved Procris intervened; and only her sweet name was on my lips. I told Aurora of our wedding joys and all refreshing joys of love—and my first union of my couch deserted now: Enraged against me, then the goddess said: `Keep to your Procris, I but trouble you, ungrateful clown! but, if you can be warned, you will no longer wish for her!’ And so, in anger, she returned me to my wife. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">tum vero iuvenis Nereius omnia quaerit,<br>cur sit et unde datum, quis tanti muneris auctor.<br>quae petit, ille refert, sed enim narrare pudori est,<br>qua tulerit mercede; silet tactusque dolore<br>coniugis amissae lacrimis ita fatur obortis:<br>'hoc me, nate dea, (quis possit credere?) telum<br>flere facit facietque diu, si vivere nobis<br>fata diu dederint; hoc me cum coniuge cara<br>perdidit: hoc utinam caruissem munere semper!<br>'Procris erat, si forte magis pervenit ad aures<br>Orithyia tuas, raptae soror Orithyiae,<br>si faciem moresque velis conferre duarum,<br>dignior ipsa rapi! pater hanc mihi iunxit Erectheus,<br>hanc mihi iunxit amor: felix dicebar eramque;<br>non ita dis visum est, aut nunc quoque forsitan essem.<br>alter agebatur post sacra iugalia mensis,<br>cum me cornigeris tendentem retia cervis<br>vertice de summo semper florentis Hymetti<br>lutea mane videt pulsis Aurora tenebris<br>invitumque rapit. liceat mihi vera referre<br>pace deae: quod sit roseo spectabilis ore,<br>quod teneat lucis, teneat confinia noctis,<br>nectareis quod alatur aquis, ego Procrin amabam;<br>pectore Procris erat, Procris mihi semper in ore.<br>sacra tori coitusque novos thalamosque recentes<br>primaque deserti referebam foedera lecti:<br>mota dea est et "siste tuas, ingrate, querellas;<br>Procrin habe!" dixit, "quod si mea provida mens est,</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="713">“Alas, as I retraced the weary way, long-brooding over all Aurora said, suspicion made me doubtful of my wife, so faithful and so fair.—But many things reminding me of steadfast virtue, I suppressed all doubts; until the dreadful thought of my long absence filled my jealous mind: from which I argued to the criminal advances of Aurora; for if she, so lovely in appearance, did conceal such passion in the garb of innocence until the moment of temptation, how could I be certain of the purity of even the strongest when the best are frail? So brooding—every effort I devised to cause my own undoing. By the means of bribing presents, favored by disguise, I sought to win her guarded chastity. Aurora had disguised me, and her guile determined me to work in subtle snares. Unknown to all my friends, I paced the streets of sacred Athens till I reached my home. I hoped to search out evidence of guilt: but everything seemed waiting my return; and all the household breathed an air of grief. With difficulty I, disguised, obtained an entrance to her presence by the use of artifices many: and when I there saw her, silent in her grief,—amazed, my heart no longer prompted me to test such constant love. An infinite desire took hold upon me. I could scarce restrain an impulse to caress and kiss her. Pale with grief that I was gone, her lovely face in sorrow was more beautiful—the world has not another so divinely fair. Ah, Phocus, it is wonderful to think of beauty so surpassing fair it seems more lovable in sorrow! <rtc lang="la" translate="no">non habuisse voles." meque illi irata remisit.<br>cum redeo mecumque deae memorata retracto,<br>esse metus coepit, ne iura iugalia coniunx<br>non bene servasset: facies aetasque iubebat<br>credere adulterium, prohibebant credere mores;<br>sed tamen afueram, sed et haec erat, unde redibam,<br>criminis exemplum, sed cuncta timemus amantes.<br>quaerere, quod doleam, statuo donisque pudicam<br>sollicitare fidem; favet huic Aurora timori<br>inmutatque meam (videor sensisse) figuram.<br>Palladias ineo non cognoscendus Athenas<br>ingrediorque domum; culpa domus ipsa carebat<br>castaque signa dabat dominoque erat anxia rapto:<br>vix aditus per mille dolos ad Erecthida factus.<br>ut vidi, obstipui meditataque paene reliqui<br>temptamenta fide; male me, quin vera faterer,<br>continui, male, quin, et oportuit, oscula ferrem.<br>tristis erat (sed nulla tamen formosior illa<br>esse potest tristi) desiderioque dolebat<br>coniugis abrepti: tu collige, qualis in illa,<br>Phoce, decor fuerit, quam sic dolor ipse decebat!</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="734">“Why relate to you how often she repulsed my feigned attempts upon her virtue? To each plea she said: `I serve one man: no matter where he may be I will keep my love for one.’ Who but a man insane with jealousy, would doubt the virtue of a loving wife, when tempted by the most insidious wiles, whose hallowed honor was her husband's love? But I, not satisfied with proof complete, would not abandon my depraved desire to poison the pure fountain I should guard;—increasing my temptations, I caused her to hesitate, and covet a rich gift. Then, angered at my own success I said, discarding all disguise, `Behold the man whose lavish promise has established proof, the witness of your shameful treachery; your absent husband has returned to this!’ Unable to endure a ruined home, where desecration held her sin to view, despairing and in silent shame she fled; and I, the author of that wickedness ran after: but enraged at my deceit and hating all mankind, she wandered far in wildest mountains; hunting the wild game. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">quid referam, quotiens temptamina nostra pudici<br>reppulerint mores, quotiens "ego" dixerit "uni<br>servor; ubicumque est, uni mea gaudia servo."<br>cui non ista fide satis experientia sano<br>magna foret? non sum contentus et in mea pugno<br>vulnera, dum census dare me pro nocte loquendo<br>muneraque augendo tandem dubitare coegi.<br>exclamo male victor: "adest, mala, fictus adulter!<br>verus eram coniunx! me, perfida, teste teneris."<br>illa nihil; tacito tantummodo victa pudore<br>insidiosa malo cum coniuge limina fugit;<br>offensaque mei genus omne perosa virorum<br>montibus errabat, studiis operata Dianae.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="747">“I grieved at her desertion; and the fires of my neglected love consumed my health; with greater violence my love increased, until unable to endure such pain, I begged forgiveness and acknowledged fault: nor hesitated to declare that I might yield, the same way tempted, if such great gifts had been offered to me. When I had made abject confession and she had avenged her outraged feelings, she came back to me and we spent golden years in harmony. She gave to me the hound she fondly loved, the very one Diana gave to her when lovingly the goddess had declared, `This hound all others shall excel in speed.’ Nor was that gift the only one was given by kind Diana when my wife was hers, as you may guess—this javelin I hold forth, no other but a goddess could bestow. Would you be told the story of both gifts attend my words and you shall be amazed, for never such another sad event has added sorrow to the grieving world. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">tum mihi deserto violentior ignis ad ossa<br>pervenit: orabam veniam et peccasse fatebar<br>et potuisse datis simili succumbere culpae<br>me quoque muneribus, si munera tanta darentur.<br>haec mihi confesso, laesum prius ulta pudorem,<br>redditur et dulces concorditer exigit annos;<br>dat mihi praeterea, tamquam se parva dedisset<br>dona, canem munus; quem cum sua traderet illi<br>Cynthia, "currendo superabit" dixerat "omnes."<br>dat simul et iaculum, manibus quod, cernis, habemus.<br>muneris alterius quae sit fortuna, requiris?<br>accipe mirandum: novitate movebere facti!</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="759">“After the son of Laius,—Oedipus,—had solved the riddle of the monster-sphinx, so often baffling to the wits of men, and after she had fallen from her hill, mangled, forgetful of her riddling craft; not unrevenged the mighty Themis brooked her loss. Without delay that goddess raised another savage beast to ravage Thebes, by which the farmer's cattle were devoured, the land was ruined and its people slain. Then all the valiant young men of the realm, with whom I also went, enclosed the field (where lurked the monster) in a mesh of many tangled nets: but not a strand could stay its onrush, and it leaped the crest of every barrier where the toils were set. Already they had urged their eager dogs, which swiftly as a bird it left behind, eluding all the hunters as it fled. At last all begged me to let slip the leash of straining Tempest; such I called the hound, my dear wife's present. As he tugged and pulled upon the tightened cords, I let them slip: no sooner done, then he was lost to sight; although, wherever struck his rapid feet the hot dust whirled. Not swifter flies the spear, nor whizzing bullet from the twisted sling, nor feathered arrow from the twanging bow! <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Carmina Laiades non intellecta priorum<br>solverat ingeniis, et praecipitata iacebat<br>inmemor ambagum vates obscura suarum:<br>protinus Aoniis inmittitur altera Thebis<br>[scilicet alma Themis nec talia linquit inulta!]<br>pestis, et exitio multi pecorumque suoque<br>rurigenae pavere feram; vicina iuventus<br>venimus et latos indagine cinximus agros.<br>illa levi velox superabat retia saltu<br>summaque transibat postarum lina plagarum:<br>copula detrahitur canibus, quas illa sequentes<br>effugit et coetum non segnior alite ludit.<br>poscor et ipse meum consensu Laelapa magno<br>(muneris hoc nomen): iamdudum vincula pugnat<br>exuere ipse sibi colloque morantia tendit.<br>vix bene missus erat, nec iam poteramus, ubi esset,<br>scire; pedum calidus vestigia pulvis habebat,<br>ipse oculis ereptus erat: non ocior illo<br>hasta nec excussae contorto verbere glandes<br>nec Gortyniaco calamus levis exit ab arcu.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="779">“A high hill jutted from a rolling plain, on which I mounted to enjoy the sight of that unequalled chase. One moment caught, the next as surely free, the wild beast seemed now here now there, elusive in its flight; swiftly sped onward, or with sudden turn doubled in circles to deceive or gain. With equal speed pursuing at each turn, the rapid hound could neither gain nor lose. Now springing forward and now doubling back, his great speed foiled, he snapped at empty air. I then turned to my javelin's aid; and while I poised it in my right hand, turned away my gaze a moment as I sought to twine my practiced fingers in the guiding thongs; but when again I lifted up my eyes, to cast the javelin where the monster sped, I saw two marble statues standing there, transformed upon the plain. One statue seemed to strain in attitude of rapid flight, the other with wide-open jaws was changed, just in the act of barking and pursuit. Surely some God—if any god controls—decreed both equal, neither could succeed.” Now after these miraculous events, it seemed he wished to stop, but Phocus said. “What charge have you against the javelin?” <rtc lang="la" translate="no">collis apex medii subiectis inminet arvis:<br>tollor eo capioque novi spectacula cursus,<br>quo modo deprendi, modo se subducere ab ipso<br>vulnere visa fera est; nec limite callida recto<br>in spatiumque fugit, sed decipit ora sequentis<br>et redit in gyrum, ne sit suus inpetus hosti:<br>inminet hic sequiturque parem similisque tenenti<br>non tenet et vanos exercet in aera morsus.<br>ad iaculi vertebar opem; quod dextera librat<br>dum mea, dum digitos amentis addere tempto,<br>lumina deflexi. revocataque rursus eodem<br>rettuleram: medio (mirum) duo marmora campo<br>adspicio; fugere hoc, illud captare putares.<br>scilicet invictos ambo certamine cursus<br>esse deus voluit, si quis deus adfuit illis.'<br>hactenus, et tacuit; 'iaculo quod crimen in ipso est?'<br>Phocus ait; iaculi sic crimina reddidit ille:</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="796">And Cephalus rejoined; “I must relate my sorrows last; for I would tell you first the story of my joys.—'Tis sweet to think, upon the gliding tide of those few years of married life, when my dear wife and I were happy in our love and confidence. No woman could allure me then from her; and even Venus could not tempt my love; all my great passion for my dearest wife was equalled by the passion she returned. As early as the sun, when golden rays first glittered on the mountains, I would rise in youthful ardor, to explore the fields in search of game. With no companions, hounds, nor steeds nor nets, this javelin was alone my safety and companion in my sport. And often when my right hand felt its weight, a-wearied of the slaughter it had caused, I would come back to rest in the cool shade, and breezes from cool vales—the breeze I wooed, blowing so gently on me in the heat; the breeze I waited for; she was my rest from labor. I remember, `Aura come,’ I used to say, `Come soothe me, come into my breast most welcome one, and yes indeed, you do relieve the heat with which I burn.’ And as I felt the sweet breeze of the morn, as if in answer to my song, my fate impelled me further to declare my joy in song; `You are my comfort, you are my delight! Refresh me, cherish me, breathe on my face! I love you child of lonely haunts and trees!’ <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Gaudia principium nostri sunt, Phoce, doloris:<br>illa prius referam. iuvat o meminisse beati<br>temporis, Aeacide, quo primos rite per annos<br>coniuge eram felix, felix erat illa marito.<br>mutua cura duos et amor socialis habebat,<br>nec Iovis illa meo thalamos praeferret amori,<br>nec me quae caperet, non si Venus ipsa veniret,<br>ulla erat; aequales urebant pectora flammae.<br>sole fere radiis feriente cacumina primis<br>venatum in silvas iuvenaliter ire solebam<br>nec mecum famuli nec equi nec naribus acres<br>ire canes nec lina sequi nodosa solebant:<br>tutus eram iaculo; sed cum satiata ferinae<br>dextera caedis erat, repetebam frigus et umbras<br>et quae de gelidis exibat vallibus aura:<br>aura petebatur medio mihi lenis in aestu,<br>auram exspectabam, requies erat illa labori.<br>"aura" (recordor enim), "venias" cantare solebam,<br>"meque iuves intresque sinus, gratissima, nostros,<br>utque facis, relevare velis, quibus urimur, aestus!"<br>forsitan addiderim (sic me mea fata trahebant),<br>blanditias plures et "tu mihi magna voluptas"<br>dicere sim solitus, "tu me reficisque fovesque,<br>tu facis, ut silvas, ut amem loca sola: meoque<br>spiritus iste tuus semper captatur ab ore."</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="821">“Such words I once was singing, not aware of some one spying on me from the trees, who thought I sang to some beloved Nymph, or goddess by the name of Aura—so I always called the breeze.—Unhappy man! The meddling tell-tale went to Procris with a story of supposed unfaithfulness, and slyly told in whispers all he heard. True love is credulous; (and as I heard the story) Procris in a swoon fell down. When she awakened from her bitter swoon, she ceased not wailing her unhappy fate, and, wretched, moaned for an imagined woe. So she lamented what was never done! Her woe incited by a whispered tale, she feared the fiction of a harmless name! But hope returning soothed her wretched state; and now, no longer willing to believe such wrong, unless her own eyes saw it, she refused to think her husband sinned. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">vocibus ambiguis deceptam praebuit aurem<br>nescio quis nomenque aurae tam saepe vocatum<br>esse putat nymphae: nympham mihi credit amari.<br>criminis extemplo ficti temerarius index<br>Procrin adit linguaque refert audita susurra.<br>credula res amor est: subito conlapsa dolore,<br>ut mihi narratur, cecidit; longoque refecta<br>tempore se miseram, se fati dixit iniqui<br>deque fide questa est et crimine concita vano,<br>quod nihil est, metuit, metuit sine corpore nomen<br>et dolet infelix veluti de paelice vera.<br>saepe tamen dubitat speratque miserrima falli<br>indiciique fidem negat et, nisi viderit ipsa,<br>damnatura sui non est delicta mariti.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="835">“When dawn had banished night, and I, rejoicing, ranged the breathing woods, victorious in the hunt paused and said, `Come Aura—lovely breeze—relieve my panting breast!’ It seemed I heard the smothered moans of sorrow as I spoke: but not conceiving harm, I said again; `Come here, oh my delight!’ And as those words fell from my lips, I thought I heard a soft sound in the thicket, as of moving leaves; and thinking surely 'twas a hidden beast, I threw this winged javelin at the spot.—It was my own wife, Procris, and the shaft was buried in her breast—`Ah, wretched me!’ She cried; and when I heard her well-known voice, distracted I ran towards her,—only to find her bathed in blood, and dying from the wound of that same javelin she had given to me: and in her agony she drew it forth,—ah me! alas! from her dear tender side. I lifted her limp body to my own, in these blood-guilty arms, and wrapped the wound with fragments of my tunic, that I tore in haste to staunch her blood; and all the while I moaned, `Oh, do not now forsake me—slain by these accursed hands!’ <rtc lang="la" translate="no">postera depulerant Aurorae lumina noctem:<br>egredior silvamque peto victorque per herbas<br>"aura, veni" dixi "nostroque medere labori!"<br>et subito gemitus inter mea verba videbar<br>nescio quos audisse; "veni" tamen "optima!" dicens<br>fronde levem rursus strepitum faciente caduca<br>sum ratus esse feram telumque volatile misi:<br>Procris erat medioque tenens in pectore vulnus<br>"ei mihi" conclamat! vox est ubi cognita fidae<br>coniugis, ad vocem praeceps amensque cucurri.<br>semianimem et sparsas foedantem sanguine vestes<br>et sua (me miserum!) de vulnere dona trahentem<br>invenio corpusque meo mihi carius ulnis<br>mollibus attollo scissaque a pectore veste<br>vulnera saeva ligo conorque inhibere cruorem<br>neu me morte sua sceleratum deserat, oro.</rtc></ruby> <ruby value="851">“Weak with the loss of blood, and dying, she compelled herself to utter these few words, `It is my death; but let my eyes not close upon this life before I plead with you!—By the dear ties of sacred marriage; by your god and mine; and if my love for you can move your heart; and even by the cause of my sad death,—my love for you increasing as I die, – ah, put away that Aura you have called, that she may never separate your soul,—your love from me.’ So, by those dying words I knew that she had heard me call the name of Aura, when I wished the cooling breeze, and thought I called a goddess,—cause of all her jealous sorrow and my bitter woe. Alas, too late, I told her the sad truth; but she was sinking, and her little strength swiftly was ebbing with her flowing blood. As long as life remained her loving gaze was fixed on mine; and her unhappy life at last was breathed out on my grieving face. It seemed to me a look of sweet content was in her face, as if she feared not death.” In tears he folds these things; and, as they wept in came the aged monarch, Aeacus, and with the monarch his two valiant sons, and troops, new-levied, trained to glorious arms. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">viribus illa carens et iam moribunda coegit<br>haec se pauca loqui: "per nostri foedera lecti<br>perque deos supplex oro superosque meosque,<br>per si quid merui de te bene perque manentem<br>nunc quoque, cum pereo, causam mihi mortis amorem,<br>ne thalamis Auram patiare innubere nostris!"<br>dixit, et errorem tum denique nominis esse<br>et sensi et docui. sed quid docuisse iuvabat?<br>labitur, et parvae fugiunt cum sanguine vires,<br>dumque aliquid spectare potest, me spectat et in me<br>infelicem animam nostroque exhalat in ore;<br>sed vultu meliore mori secura videtur.'<br>Flentibus haec lacrimans heros memorabat, et ecce<br>Aeacus ingreditur duplici cum prole novoque<br>milite; quem Cephalus cum fortibus accipit armis.</rtc></ruby></ol><nav><a href="#!/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/metamorphoses/book6/" rel="prev">Previous</a> <a href="#!/metamorphoses/book8/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><small>Translated by <u>Brookes More</u>, <span itemprop="copyrightYear">1922</span>.<br/>Original Latin and English translation are in public domain.</small></article>
