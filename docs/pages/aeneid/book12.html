As the lion in Phoenician fields, his breast heavily wounded by the huntsmen, at last starts into arms, and shakes out the shaggy masses from his exultant neck, and undismayed snaps the brigand's planted weapon, roaring with blood-stained mouth; even so Turnus kindles and swells in passion. Then he thus addresses the king, and so furiously begins: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Turnus ut infractos aduerso Marte Latinos<br>defecisse uidet, sua nunc promissa reposci,<br>se signari oculis, ultro implacabilis ardet<br>attollitque animos. Poenorum qualis in aruis<br>saucius ille graui uenantum uulnere pectus<br>tum demum mouet arma leo, gaudetque comantis<br>excutiens ceruice toros fixumque latronis<br>impauidus frangit telum et fremit ore cruento:<br>haud secus accenso gliscit uiolentia Turno.<br>tum sic adfatur regem atque ita turbidus infit:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Turnus stops not the way; there is no excuse for the coward Aeneadae to take back their words or renounce their compact. I join battle; bring the holy things, my lord, and swear the treaty. Either this hand shall hurl to hell the Dardanian who skulks from Asia, and the Latins sit and see my single sword wipe out the nation's reproach; or let him rule his conquest, and Lavinia pass to his espousal." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'nulla mora in Turno; nihil est quod dicta retractent<br>ignaui Aeneadae, nec quae pepigere recusent:<br>congredior. fer sacra, pater, et concipe foedus.<br>aut hac Dardanium dextra sub Tartara mittam<br>desertorem Asiae (sedeant spectentque Latini),<br>et solus ferro crimen commune refellam,<br>aut habeat uictos, cedat Lauinia coniunx.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>To him Latinus calmly replied: "O excellent young man! the more thy hot valour abounds, the more intently must I counsel, and weigh fearfully what may befall. Thou hast thy father Daunus" realm, hast many towns taken by thine hand, nor is Latinus lacking in gold and goodwill. There are other maidens unwedded in Latium and Laurentine fields, and of no mean birth. Let me unfold this hard saying in all sincerity: and do thou drink it into thy soul. I might not ally my daughter to any of her old wooers; such was the universal oracle of gods and men. Overborne by love for thee, overborne by kinship of blood and my weeping wife's complaint, I broke all fetters, I severed the maiden from her promised husband, I took up unrighteous arms. Since then, Turnus, thou seest what calamities, what wars pursue me, what woes thyself before all dost suffer. Twice vanquished in pitched battle, we scarce guard in our city walls the hopes of Italy: the streams of Tiber yet run warm with our blood, and our bones whiten the boundless plain. Why fall I away again and again? what madness bends my purpose? if I am ready to take them into alliance after Turnus' destruction, why do I not rather bar the strife while he lives? What will thy Rutulian kinsmen, will all Italy say, if thy death—Fortune make void the word!—comes by my betrayal, while thou suest for our daughter in marriage? Cast a glance on war's changing fortune; pity thine aged father, who now far away sits sad in his native Ardea." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Olli sedato respondit corde Latinus:<br>'o praestans animi iuuenis, quantum ipse feroci<br>uirtute exsuperas, tanto me impensius aequum est<br>consulere atque omnis metuentem expendere casus.<br>sunt tibi regna patris Dauni, sunt oppida capta<br>multa manu, nec non aurumque animusque Latino est;<br>sunt aliae innuptae Latio et Laurentibus aruis<br>nec genus indecores. sine me haec haud mollia fatu<br>sublatis aperire dolis, simul hoc animo hauri:<br>me natam nulli ueterum sociare procorum<br>fas erat, idque omnes diuique hominesque canebant.<br>uictus amore tui, cognato sanguine uictus<br>coniugis et maestae lacrimis, uincla omnia rupi;<br>promissam eripui genero, arma impia sumpsi.<br>ex illo qui me casus, quae, Turne, sequantur<br>bella, uides, quantos primus patiare labores.<br>bis magna uicti pugna uix urbe tuemur<br>spes Italas; recalent nostro Thybrina fluenta<br>sanguine adhuc campique ingentes ossibus albent.<br>quo referor totiens? quae mentem insania mutat?<br>si Turno exstincto socios sum ascire paratus,<br>cur non incolumi potius certamina tollo?<br>quid consanguinei Rutuli, quid cetera dicet<br>Italia, ad mortem si te (fors dicta refutet!)<br>prodiderim, natam et conubia nostra petentem?<br>respice res bello uarias, miserere parentis<br>longaeui, quem nunc maestum patria Ardea longe<br>diuidit.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>In nowise do the words bend Turnus' passion: he rages the more fiercely, and sickens of the cure. So soon as he found speech he thus made utterance: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">haudquaquam dictis uiolentia Turni<br>flectitur; exsuperat magis aegrescitque medendo.<br>ut primum fari potuit, sic institit ore:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"The care thou hast for me, most gracious lord, for me lay down, I implore thee, and let me purchase honour with death. Our hand too rains weapons, our steel is strong; and our wounds too draw blood. The goddess his mother will be far from him to cover his flight, woman-like, in a cloud and an empty phantom's hiding." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'quam pro me curam geris, hanc precor, optime, pro me<br>deponas letumque sinas pro laude pacisci.<br>et nos tela, pater, ferrumque haud debile dextra<br>spargimus, et nostro sequitur de uulnere sanguis.<br>longe illi dea mater erit, quae nube fugacem<br>feminea tegat et uanis sese occulat umbris.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But the queen, dismayed by the new terms of battle, wept, and clung to her fiery son as one ready to die: "Turnus, by these tears, by Amata's regard, if that touches thee at all—thou art now the one hope, the repose of mine unhappy age; in thine hand is Latinus' honour and empire, on thee is the weight of all our sinking house—one thing I beseech thee; forbear to join battle with the Teucrians. What fate soever awaits thee in the strife thou seekest, it awaits me, Turnus, too: with thee will I leave the hateful light, nor shall my captive eyes see Aeneas my daughter's lord." Lavinia tearfully heard her mother's words with cheeks all aflame, as deep blushes set her face on fire and ran hotly over it. Even as Indian ivory, if one stain it with sanguine dye, or where white lilies are red with many a rose amid: such colour came on the maiden's face. Love throws him into tumult, and stays his countenance on the girl: he burns fiercer for arms, and briefly answers Amata: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At regina noua pugnae conterrita sorte<br>flebat et ardentem generum moritura tenebat:<br>'Turne, per has ego te lacrimas, per si quis Amatae<br>tangit honos animum: spes tu nunc una, senectae<br>tu requies miserae, decus imperiumque Latini<br>te penes, in te omnis domus inclinata recumbit.<br>unum oro: desiste manum committere Teucris.<br>qui te cumque manent isto certamine casus<br>et me, Turne, manent; simul haec inuisa relinquam<br>lumina nec generum Aenean captiua uidebo.'<br>accepit uocem lacrimis Lauinia matris<br>flagrantis perfusa genas, cui plurimus ignem<br>subiecit rubor et calefacta per ora cucurrit.<br>Indum sanguineo ueluti uiolauerit ostro<br>si quis ebur, aut mixta rubent ubi lilia multa<br>alba rosa, talis uirgo dabat ore colores.<br>illum turbat amor figitque in uirgine uultus;<br>ardet in arma magis paucisque adfatur Amatam:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Do not, I pray thee, do not weep for me, neither pursue me thus ominously as I go to the stern shock of war. Turnus is not free to dally with death. Thou, Idmon, bear my message to the Phrygian monarch in this harsh wording: So soon as to-morrow's Dawn rises in the sky blushing on her crimson wheels, let him not loose Teucrian or Rutulian: let Teucrian and Rutulian arms have rest, and our blood decide the war; on that field let Lavinia be sought in marriage." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'ne, quaeso, ne me lacrimis neue omine tanto<br>prosequere in duri certamina Martis euntem,<br>o mater; neque enim Turno mora libera mortis.<br>nuntius haec, Idmon, Phrygio mea dicta tyranno<br>haud placitura refer. cum primum crastina caelo<br>puniceis inuecta rotis Aurora rubebit,<br>non Teucros agat in Rutulos, Teucrum arma quiescant<br>et Rutuli; nostro dirimamus sanguine bellum,<br>illo quaeratur coniunx Lauinia campo.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>These words uttered, withdrawing swiftly homeward, he orders out his horses, and rejoicingly beholds them snorting before his face: those that Orithyia's self gave to grace Pilumnus, such as would excel the snows in whiteness and the gales in speed. The eager charioteers stand round and pat their chests with clapping hollowed hands, and comb their tressed manes. Himself next he girds on his shoulders the corslet stiff with gold and pale mountain-bronze, and buckles on the sword and shield and scarlet-plumed helmet-spikes: that sword the divine Lord of Fire had himself forged for his father Daunus and dipped glowing in the Stygian wave. Next, where it stood amid his dwelling leaning on a massy pillar, he strongly seizes his stout spear, the spoil of Actor the Auruncan, and brandishes it quivering, and cries aloud: "Now, O spear that never hast failed at my call, now the time is come; thee princely Actor once, thee Turnus now wields in his grasp. Grant this strong hand to strike down the effeminate Phrygian, to rend and shatter the corslet, and defile in dust the locks curled with hot iron and wet with myrrh." Thus madly he runs on: sparkles leap out from all his blazing face, and his keen eyes flash fire: even as the bull when before his first fight he bellows awfully, and drives against a tree's trunk to make trial of his angry horns, and buffets the air with blows or scatters the sand in prelude of battle. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta dedit rapidusque in tecta recessit,<br>poscit equos gaudetque tuens ante ora frementis,<br>Pilumno quos ipsa decus dedit Orithyia,<br>qui candore niues anteirent, cursibus auras.<br>circumstant properi aurigae manibusque lacessunt<br>pectora plausa cauis et colla comantia pectunt.<br>ipse dehinc auro squalentem alboque orichalco<br>circumdat loricam umeris, simul aptat habendo<br>ensemque clipeumque et rubrae cornua cristae,<br>ensem quem Dauno ignipotens deus ipse parenti<br>fecerat et Stygia candentem tinxerat unda.<br>exim quae mediis ingenti adnixa columnae<br>aedibus astabat, ualidam ui corripit hastam,<br>Actoris Aurunci spolium, quassatque trementem<br>uociferans: 'nunc, o numquam frustrata uocatus<br>hasta meos, nunc tempus adest: te maximus Actor,<br>te Turni nunc dextra gerit; da sternere corpus<br>loricamque manu ualida lacerare reuulsam<br>semiuiri Phrygis et foedare in puluere crinis<br>uibratos calido ferro murraque madentis.'<br>his agitur furiis, totoque ardentis ab ore<br>scintillae absistunt, oculis micat acribus ignis,<br>mugitus ueluti cum prima in proelia taurus<br>terrificos ciet aut irasci in cornua temptat<br>arboris obnixus trunco, uentosque lacessit<br>ictibus aut sparsa ad pugnam proludit harena.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And therewithal Aeneas, terrible in his mother's armour, kindles for warfare and awakes into wrath, rejoicing that offer of treaty stays the war. Comforting his comrades and sorrowing Iülus' fear, he instructs them of destiny, and bids bear answer of assurance to King Latinus, and name the laws of peace. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nec minus interea maternis saeuus in armis<br>Aeneas acuit Martem et se suscitat ira,<br>oblato gaudens componi foedere bellum.<br>tum socios maestique metum solatur Iuli<br>fata docens, regique iubet responsa Latino<br>certa referre uiros et pacis dicere leges.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Scarcely did the morrow shed on the mountain-tops the beams of risen day, as the horses of the sun begin to rise from the deep flood and breathe light from their lifted nostrils; Rutulian and Teucrian men measured out and made ready a field of battle under the great city's ramparts, and midway in it hearth-fires and grassy altars to the gods of both peoples; while others bore spring water and fire, draped in priestly dress and their brows bound with grass of the field. The Ausonian army issue forth, and crowd through the gates in streaming serried columns. On this side all the Trojan and Tyrrhenian host pour in diverse armament, girt with iron even as though the harsh battle-strife called them forth. Therewith amid their thousands the captains dart up and down, splendid in gold and purple, Mnestheus, seed of Assaracus, and brave Asilas, and Messapus, tamer of horses, brood of Neptune: then each on signal given retired to his own ground; they plant their spears in the earth and lean their shields against them. Mothers in eager abandonment, and the unarmed crowd and feeble elders beset towers and house-roofs, or stand at the lofty gates. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postera uix summos spargebat lumine montis<br>orta dies, cum primum alto se gurgite tollunt<br>Solis equi lucemque elatis naribus efflant:<br>campum ad certamen magnae sub moenibus urbis<br>dimensi Rutulique uiri Teucrique parabant<br>in medioque focos et dis communibus aras<br>gramineas. alii fontemque ignemque ferebant<br>uelati limo et uerbena tempora uincti.<br>procedit legio Ausonidum, pilataque plenis<br>agmina se fundunt portis. hinc Troius omnis<br>Tyrrhenusque ruit uariis exercitus armis,<br>haud secus instructi ferro quam si aspera Martis<br>pugna uocet. nec non mediis in milibus ipsi<br>ductores auro uolitant ostroque superbi,<br>et genus Assaraci Mnestheus et fortis Asilas<br>et Messapus equum domitor, Neptunia proles;<br>utque dato signo spatia in sua quisque recessit,<br>defigunt tellure hastas et scuta reclinant.<br>tum studio effusae matres et uulgus inermum<br>inualidique senes turris ac tecta domorum<br>obsedere, alii portis sublimibus astant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But Juno, on the summit that is now called the Alban—then the mountain had neither name nor fame or honour—looked forth from the hill and surveyed the plain and double lines of Laurentine and Trojan, and Latinus' town. Straightway spoke she thus to Turnus' sister, goddess to goddess, lady of pools and noisy rivers: such worship did Jupiter the high king of air consecrate to her for her stolen virginity: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At Iuno ex summo (qui nunc Albanus habetur;<br>tum neque nomen erat neque honos aut gloria monti)<br>prospiciens tumulo campum aspectabat et ambas<br>Laurentum Troumque acies urbemque Latini.<br>extemplo Turni sic est adfata sororem<br>diua deam, stagnis quae fluminibusque sonoris<br>praesidet (hunc illi rex aetheris altus honorem<br>Iuppiter erepta pro uirginitate sacrauit):</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Nymph, grace of rivers, best beloved of our soul, thou knowest how out of all the Latin women that ever rose to high-hearted Jove's thankless bed, thee only have I preferred and gladly given part and place in heaven.

Now I see him joining battle with unequal fates, and the day of doom and deadly force draws nigh. Mine eyes cannot look on this battle and treaty: thou, if thou darest aught of more present help for the brother of thy blood, go on; it befits thee. Haply relief shall follow misery." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'nympha, decus fluuiorum, animo gratissima nostro,<br>scis ut te cunctis unam, quaecumque Latinae<br>magnanimi Iouis ingratum ascendere cubile,<br>praetulerim caelique libens in parte locarim:<br>disce tuum, ne me incuses, Iuturna, dolorem.<br>qua uisa est Fortuna pati Parcaeque sinebant<br>cedere res Latio, Turnum et tua moenia texi;<br>nunc iuuenem imparibus uideo concurrere fatis,<br>Parcarumque dies et uis inimica propinquat.<br>non pugnam aspicere hanc oculis, non foedera possum.<br>tu pro germano si quid praesentius audes,<br>perge; decet. forsan miseros meliora sequentur.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Scarcely thus: when Juturna's eyes overbrimmed with tears, and thrice and again she smote her hand on her gracious breast. "This is not time for tears," cries Juno, daughter of Saturn: "hasten and snatch thy brother, if it may be, from his death; or do thou waken war, and make the treaty abortive. I encourage thee to dare." With such urgence she left her, doubting and dismayed, and grievously wounded in soul. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">uix ea, cum lacrimas oculis Iuturna profundit<br>terque quaterque manu pectus percussit honestum.<br>'non lacrimis hoc tempus' ait Saturnia Iuno:<br>'accelera et fratrem, si quis modus, eripe morti;<br>aut tu bella cie conceptumque excute foedus.<br>auctor ego audendi.' sic exhortata reliquit<br>incertam et tristi turbatam uulnere mentis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile the kings go forth; Latinus in mighty pomp rides in his four-horse chariot; twelve gilded rays go glittering round his brows, symbol of the Sun his ancestor; Turnus moves behind a white pair, clenching in his hand two broad-headed spears. On this side lord Aeneas, fount of the Roman race, ablaze in starlike shield and celestial arms, and close by Ascanius, second hope of mighty Rome, issue from the camp; and the priest, in spotless raiment, hath brought the young of a bristly sow and an unshorn sheep of two years old, and set his beasts by the blazing altars. They, turning their eyes towards the sunrising, scatter salted corn from their hands and clip the beasts with steel over the temples, and pour cups on the altars. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea reges ingenti mole Latinus<br>quadriiugo uehitur curru (cui tempora circum<br>aurati bis sex radii fulgentia cingunt,<br>Solis aui specimen), bigis it Turnus in albis,<br>bina manu lato crispans hastilia ferro.<br>hinc pater Aeneas, Romanae stirpis origo,<br>sidereo flagrans clipeo et caelestibus armis<br>et iuxta Ascanius, magnae spes altera Romae,<br>procedunt castris, puraque in ueste sacerdos<br>saetigeri fetum suis intonsamque bidentem<br>attulit admouitque pecus flagrantibus aris.<br>illi ad surgentem conuersi lumina solem<br>dant fruges manibus salsas et tempora ferro<br>summa notant pecudum, paterisque altaria libant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then Aeneas the good, with sword drawn, thus makes invocation: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum pius Aeneas stricto sic ense precatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Be the Sun now witness, and this Earth to my call, for whose sake I have borne to suffer so sore travail, and the Lord omnipotent, and thou his wife, at last, divine daughter of Saturn, at last I pray more favourable; and thou, mighty Mavors, who wieldest all warfare in lordship beneath thy sway; and on the Springs and Rivers I call, and the Dread of high heaven, and the divinities of the blue seas: if haply victory fall to Turnus the Ausonian, the vanquished make covenant to withdraw to Evander's city; Iülus shall quit the soil; nor ever hereafter shall the Aeneadae return in arms to renew warfare, or attack this realm with the sword. But if Victory grant battle to us and ours (as I think the rather, and so the rather may the gods seal their will), I will not bid Italy obey my Teucrians, nor do I claim the realm for mine; let both nations, unconquered, join treaty for ever under equal law. Gods and worship shall be of my giving: my father Latinus shall bear the sword, and have a father's prescribed command.

Soon as Juturna his sister saw this talk spread, and the people's mind waver in uncertainty, into the mid ranks, in feigned form of Camertus—his family was high in long ancestry, and his father's name for valour renowned, and himself most valiant in arms—into the mid ranks she glides, not ignorant of her task, and scatters diverse rumours, saying thus: "Shame, O Rutulians! shall we set one life in the breach for so many such as these? are we unequal in numbers or bravery? See, Troy and Arcadia is all they bring, and those fate-bound bands that Etruria hurls on Turnus. Scarce is there an enemy to meet every other man of ours. He indeed will ascend to the gods for whose altars he devotes himself, and move living in the lips of men: we, our country lost, shall bow to the haughty rigour of our lords, if we now sit slackly on the field." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At uero Rutulis impar ea pugna uideri<br>iamdudum et uario misceri pectora motu,<br>tum magis ut propius cernunt non uiribus aequos.<br>adiuuat incessu tacito progressus et aram<br>suppliciter uenerans demisso lumine Turnus<br>pubentesque genae et iuuenali in corpore pallor.<br>quem simul ac Iuturna soror crebrescere uidit<br>sermonem et uulgi uariare labantia corda,<br>in medias acies formam adsimulata Camerti,<br>cui genus a proauis ingens clarumque paternae<br>nomen erat uirtutis, et ipse acerrimus armis,<br>in medias dat sese acies haud nescia rerum<br>rumoresque serit uarios ac talia fatur:<br>'non pudet, o Rutuli, pro cunctis talibus unam<br>obiectare animam? numerone an uiribus aequi<br>non sumus? en, omnes et Troes et Arcades hi sunt,<br>fatalisque manus, infensa Etruria Turno:<br>uix hostem, alterni si congrediamur, habemus.<br>ille quidem ad superos, quorum se deuouet aris,<br>succedet fama uiuusque per ora feretur;<br>nos patria amissa dominis parere superbis<br>cogemur, qui nunc lenti consedimus aruis.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>By such words the soldiers' counsel was kindled yet higher and higher, and a murmur crept through their columns; the very Laurentines, the very Latins are changed; and they who but now hoped for rest from battle and rescue of fortune now desire arms and pray the treaty were undone, and pity Turnus' cruel lot. To this Juturna adds a yet stronger impulse, and high in heaven shews a sign more potent than any to confuse Italian souls with delusive augury. For on the crimsoned sky Jove's tawny bird flew chasing, in a screaming crowd, fowl of the shore that winged their column; then suddenly stooping to the water, pounces on a noble swan with merciless crooked talons. The startled Italians watch, while all the birds together clamorously wheel round from flight, wonderful to see, and dim the sky with their pinions, and in thickening cloud urge their foe through air, till, conquered by their attack and his heavy prey, he yielded and dropped it from his talons into the river, and winged his way deep into the clouds. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talibus incensa est iuuenum sententia dictis<br>iam magis atque magis, serpitque per agmina murmur:<br>ipsi Laurentes mutati ipsique Latini.<br>qui sibi iam requiem pugnae rebusque salutem<br>sperabant, nunc arma uolunt foedusque precantur<br>infectum et Turni sortem miserantur iniquam.<br>his aliud maius Iuturna adiungit et alto<br>dat signum caelo, quo non praesentius ullum<br>turbauit mentes Italas monstroque fefellit.<br>namque uolans rubra fuluus Iouis ales in aethra<br>litoreas agitabat auis turbamque sonantem<br>agminis aligeri, subito cum lapsus ad undas<br>cycnum excellentem pedibus rapit improbus uncis.<br>arrexere animos Itali, cunctaeque uolucres<br>conuertunt clamore fugam (mirabile uisu),<br>aetheraque obscurant pennis hostemque per auras<br>facta nube premunt, donec ui uictus et ipso<br>pondere defecit praedamque ex unguibus ales<br>proiecit fluuio, penitusque in nubila fugit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then indeed the Rutulians clamorously greet the omen, and their hands flash out. And Tolumnius the augur cries before them all: "This it was, this, that my vows often have sought; I welcome and know a deity; follow me, follow, snatch up the sword, O hapless people whom the greedy alien frightens with his arms like silly birds, and with strong hand ravages your shores. He too will take to flight, and spread his sails afar over ocean. Do you with one heart close up your squadrons, and defend in battle your lost king.' He spoke, and darting forward, hurled a weapon full on the enemy; the whistling cornel-shaft sings, and unerringly cleaves the air. At once and with it a vast shout goes up, and all their rows are amazed, and their hearts hotly stirred. The spear flies on; where haply stood opposite in ninefold brotherhood all the beautiful sons of one faithful Tyrrhene wife, borne of her to Gylippus the Arcadian, one of them, midway where the sewn belt rubs on the flank and the clasp bites the fastenings of the side, one of them, excellent in beauty and glittering in arms, it pierces clean through the ribs and stretches on the yellow sand. But of his banded brethren, their courage fired by grief, some grasp and draw their swords, some snatch weapons to throw, and rush blindly forward. The Laurentine columns rush forth against them; again from the other side Trojans and Agyllines and Arcadians in painted armour flood thickly in: so hath one passion seized all to make decision by the sword. They pull the altars to pieces; through all the air goes a thick storm of weapons, and faster falls the iron rain. Bowls and hearth-fires are carried off; Latinus himself retreats, bearing the outraged gods of the broken treaty. The others harness their chariots, or vault upon their horses and come up with swords drawn. Messapus, eager to shatter the treaty, rides menacingly down on Aulestes the Tyrrhenian, a king in a king's array. Retreating hastily, and tripped on the altars that meet him behind, the hapless man goes down on his head and shoulders. But Messapus flies up with wrathful spear, and strikes him, as he pleads sore, a deep downward blow from horseback with his beam-like spear, saying thus: <i>That for him: the high gods take this better victim.</i> The Italians crowd in and strip his warm limbs. Corynaeus seizes a charred brand from the altar, and meeting Ebysus as he advances to strike, darts the flame in his face; his heavy beard flamed up, and gave out a scorched smell. Following up his enemy's confusion, the other seizes him with his left hand by the hair, and bears him to earth with a thrust of his planted knee, and there drives the unyielding sword into his side. Podalirius pursues and overhangs with naked sword the shepherd Alsus as he rushes amid the foremost line of weapons; Alsus swings back his axe, and severs brow and chin full in front, wetting his armour all over with spattered blood. Grim rest and iron slumber seal his eyes; his lids close on everlasting night. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum uero augurium Rutuli clamore salutant<br>expediuntque manus, primusque Tolumnius augur<br>'hoc erat, hoc uotis' inquit 'quod saepe petiui.<br>accipio agnoscoque deos; me, me duce ferrum<br>corripite, o miseri, quos improbus aduena bello<br>territat inualidas ut auis, et litora uestra<br>ui populat. petet ille fugam penitusque profundo<br>uela dabit. uos unanimi densete cateruas<br>et regem uobis pugna defendite raptum.'<br>dixit, et aduersos telum contorsit in hostis<br>procurrens; sonitum dat stridula cornus et auras<br>certa secat. simul hoc, simul ingens clamor et omnes<br>turbati cunei calefactaque corda tumultu.<br>hasta uolans, ut forte nouem pulcherrima fratrum<br>corpora constiterant contra, quos fida crearat<br>una tot Arcadio coniunx Tyrrhena Gylippo,<br>horum unum ad medium, teritur qua sutilis aluo<br>balteus et laterum iuncturas fibula mordet,<br>egregium forma iuuenem et fulgentibus armis,<br>transadigit costas fuluaque effundit harena.<br>at fratres, animosa phalanx accensaque luctu,<br>pars gladios stringunt manibus, pars missile ferrum<br>corripiunt caecique ruunt. quos agmina contra<br>procurrunt Laurentum, hinc densi rursus inundant<br>Troes Agyllinique et pictis Arcades armis:<br>sic omnis amor unus habet decernere ferro.<br>diripuere aras, it toto turbida caelo<br>tempestas telorum ac ferreus ingruit imber,<br>craterasque focosque ferunt. fugit ipse Latinus<br>pulsatos referens infecto foedere diuos.<br>infrenant alii currus aut corpora saltu<br>subiciunt in equos et strictis ensibus adsunt.<br>Messapus regem regisque insigne gerentem<br>Tyrrhenum Aulesten, auidus confundere foedus,<br>aduerso proterret equo; ruit ille recedens<br>et miser oppositis a tergo inuoluitur aris<br>in caput inque umeros. at feruidus aduolat hasta<br>Messapus teloque orantem multa trabali<br>desuper altus equo grauiter ferit atque ita fatur:<br>'hoc habet, haec melior magnis data uictima diuis.'<br>concurrunt Itali spoliantque calentia membra.<br>obuius ambustum torrem Corynaeus ab ara<br>corripit et uenienti Ebyso plagamque ferenti<br>occupat os flammis: olli ingens barba reluxit<br>nidoremque ambusta dedit. super ipse secutus<br>caesariem laeua turbati corripit hostis<br>impressoque genu nitens terrae applicat ipsum;<br>sic rigido latus ense ferit.

What is this strife that so spreads and swells? Ah, restrain your wrath! truce is already stricken, and all its laws ordained; mine alone is the right of battle. Leave me alone, and my hand shall confirm the treaty; these rites already make Turnus mine." Amid these accents, amid words like these, lo! a whistling arrow winged its way to him, sped from what hand or driven by what god, none knows, or what chance or deity brought such honour to the Rutulians; the renown of the high deed was buried, nor did any boast to have dealt Aeneas' wound. Turnus, when he saw Aeneas retreating from the ranks and his captains in dismay, burns hot with sudden hope. At once he calls for his horses and armour, and with a bound leaps proudly into his chariot and handles the reins. He darts on, dealing many a brave man's body to death; many an one he rolls half-slain, or crushes whole files under his chariot, or seizes and showers spears on the fugitives. As when by the streams of icy Hebrus Mavors kindles to bloodshed and clashes on his shield, and stirs war and speeds his furious coursers; they outwing south winds and west on the open plain; utmost Thrace groans under their hoof-beats; and around in the god's train rush the faces of dark Terror, and Wraths and Ambushes; even so amid the battle Turnus briskly lashes on his reeking horses, trampling on the foes that lie piteously slain; the galloping hoof scatters bloody dew, and spurns mingled gore and sand. And now hath he dealt Sthenelus to death, and Thamyrus and Pholus, him and him at close quarters, the other from afar; from afar both the sons of Imbrasus, Glaucus and Lades, whom Imbrasus himself had nurtured in Lycia and equipped in equal arms, whether to meet hand to hand or to outstrip the winds on horseback. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At pius Aeneas dextram tendebat inermem<br>nudato capite atque suos clamore uocabat:<br>'quo ruitis? quaeue ista repens discordia surgit?<br>o cohibete iras! ictum iam foedus et omnes<br>compositae leges. mihi ius concurrere soli;<br>me sinite atque auferte metus. ego foedera faxo<br>firma manu; Turnum debent haec iam mihi sacra.'<br>has inter uoces, media inter talia uerba<br>ecce uiro stridens alis adlapsa sagitta est,<br>incertum qua pulsa manu, quo turbine adacta,<br>quis tantam Rutulis laudem, casusne deusne,<br>attulerit; pressa est insignis gloria facti,<br>nec sese Aeneae iactauit uulnere quisquam.<br>Turnus ut Aenean cedentem ex agmine uidit<br>turbatosque duces, subita spe feruidus ardet;<br>poscit equos atque arma simul, saltuque superbus<br>emicat in currum et manibus molitur habenas.<br>multa uirum uolitans dat fortia corpora leto.<br>seminecis uoluit multos: aut agmina curru<br>proterit aut raptas fugientibus ingerit hastas.<br>qualis apud gelidi cum flumina concitus Hebri<br>sanguineus Mauors clipeo increpat atque furentis<br>bella mouens immittit equos, illi aequore aperto<br>ante Notos Zephyrumque uolant, gemit ultima pulsu<br>Thraca pedum circumque atrae Formidinis ora<br>Iraeque Insidiaeque, dei comitatus, aguntur:<br>talis equos alacer media inter proelia Turnus<br>fumantis sudore quatit, miserabile caesis<br>hostibus insultans; spargit rapida ungula rores<br>sanguineos mixtaque cruor calcatur harena.<br>iamque neci Sthenelumque dedit Thamyrumque Pholumque,<br>hunc congressus et hunc, illum eminus; eminus ambo<br>Imbrasidas, Glaucum atque Laden, quos Imbrasus ipse<br>nutrierat Lycia paribusque ornauerat armis<br>uel conferre manum uel equo praeuertere uentos.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Elsewhere Eumedes advances amid the fray, ancient Dolon's brood, illustrious in war, renewing his grandfather's name, his father's courage and strength of hand, who of old dared to claim Pelides' chariot as his price if he went to spy out the Grecian camp; to him the son of Tydeus told out another price for his venture, and he dreams no more of Achilles' horses. Him Turnus descried far on the open plain, and first following him with light javelin through long space of air, stops his double-harnessed horses and leaps from the chariot, and descends on his fallen half-lifeless foe, and, planting his foot on his neck, wrests the blade out of his hand and dyes its glitter deep in his throat, adding these words withal: "Behold, thou liest, Trojan, meting out those Hesperian fields thou didst seek in war. Such guerdon is theirs who dare to tempt my sword; thus do they found their city." Then with a spear-cast he sends Asbutes to follow him, and Chloreus and Sybaris, Dares and Thersilochus, and Thymoetes fallen flung over his horse's neck. And as when the Edonian North wind's wrath roars on the deep Aegean, and the wave follows it shoreward; where the blast comes down, the clouds race over the sky; so, wheresoever Turnus cleaves his way, columns retreat and lines turn and run; his own speed bears him on, and his flying plume tosses as his chariot meets the breeze. Phegeus brooked not his proud approach; he faced the chariot, and caught and twisted away in his right hand the mouths of his horses, spurred into speed and foaming on the bit. Dragged along and hanging by the yoke he is left uncovered; the broad lance-head reaches him, pins and pierces the double-woven breastplate, and lightly wounds the surface of his body. Yet turning, he advanced on the enemy behind his shield, and sought succour in the naked point; when the wheel running forward on its swift axle struck him headlong and flung him to ground, and Turnus' sword following it smote off his head between the helmet-rim and the upper border of the breastplate, and left the body on the sand. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Parte alia media Eumedes in proelia fertur,<br>antiqui proles bello praeclara Dolonis,<br>nomine auum referens, animo manibusque parentem,<br>qui quondam, castra ut Danaum speculator adiret,<br>ausus Pelidae pretium sibi poscere currus;<br>illum Tydides alio pro talibus ausis<br>adfecit pretio nec equis aspirat Achilli.<br>hunc procul ut campo Turnus prospexit aperto,<br>ante leui iaculo longum per inane secutus<br>sistit equos biiugis et curru desilit atque<br>semianimi lapsoque superuenit, et pede collo<br>impresso dextrae mucronem extorquet et alto<br>fulgentem tingit iugulo atque haec insuper addit:<br>'en agros et, quam bello, Troiane, petisti,<br>Hesperiam metire iacens: haec praemia, qui me<br>ferro ausi temptare, ferunt, sic moenia condunt.'<br>huic comitem Asbyten coniecta cuspide mittit<br>Chloreaque Sybarimque Daretaque Thersilochumque<br>et sternacis equi lapsum ceruice Thymoeten.<br>ac uelut Edoni Boreae cum spiritus alto<br>insonat Aegaeo sequiturque ad litora fluctus,<br>qua uenti incubuere, fugam dant nubila caelo:<br>sic Turno, quacumque uiam secat, agmina cedunt<br>conuersaeque ruunt acies; fert impetus ipsum<br>et cristam aduerso curru quatit aura uolantem.<br>non tulit instantem Phegeus animisque frementem<br>obiecit sese ad currum et spumantia frenis<br>ora citatorum dextra detorsit equorum.<br>dum trahitur pendetque iugis, hunc lata retectum<br>lancea consequitur rumpitque infixa bilicem<br>loricam et summum degustat uulnere corpus.<br>ille tamen clipeo obiecto conuersus in hostem<br>ibat et auxilium ducto mucrone petebat,<br>cum rota praecipitem et procursu concitus axis<br>impulit effunditque solo, Turnusque secutus<br>imam inter galeam summi thoracis et oras<br>abstulit ense caput truncumque reliquit harenae.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And while Turnus thus victoriously deals death over the plains, Mnestheus meantime and faithful Achates, and Ascanius by their side, set down Aeneas in the camp, dabbled with blood and leaning every other step on his long spear. He storms, and tries hard to pull out the dart where the reed had broken, and calls for the nearest way of remedy, to cut open the wound with broad blade, and tear apart the weapon's lurking-place, and so send him back to battle. And now Iapix son of Iasus came, beloved beyond others of Phoebus, to whom once of old, smitten with sharp desire, Apollo gladly offered his own arts and gifts, augury and the lyre and swift arrows: he, to lengthen out the destiny of a parent given over to die, chose rather to know the potency of herbs and the practice of healing, and deal in a silent art unrenowned. Aeneas stood chafing bitterly, propped on his vast spear, mourning Iülus and a great crowd of men around, unstirred by their tears. The aged man, with garment drawn back and girt about him in Paeonian fashion, makes many a hurried effort with healing hand and the potent herbs of Phoebus, all in vain; in vain his hand solicits the arrow-head, and his pincers' grasp pulls at the steel. Fortune leads him forward in nowise; Apollo aids not with counsel; and more and more the fierce clash swells over the plains, and the havoc draws nigher on. Already they see the sky a mass of dust, the cavalry approaching, and shafts falling thickly amid the camp; the dismal cry uprises of warriors fighting and falling under the War-god's heavy hand. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Atque ea dum campis uictor dat funera Turnus,<br>interea Aenean Mnestheus et fidus Achates<br>Ascaniusque comes castris statuere cruentum<br>alternos longa nitentem cuspide gressus.<br>saeuit et infracta luctatur harundine telum<br>eripere auxilioque uiam, quae proxima, poscit:<br>ense secent lato uulnus telique latebram<br>rescindant penitus, seseque in bella remittant.<br>iamque aderat Phoebo ante alios dilectus Iapyx<br>Iasides, acri quondam cui captus amore<br>ipse suas artis, sua munera, laetus Apollo<br>augurium citharamque dabat celerisque sagittas.<br>ille, ut depositi proferret fata parentis,<br>scire potestates herbarum usumque medendi<br>maluit et mutas agitare inglorius artis.<br>stabat acerba fremens ingentem nixus in hastam<br>Aeneas magno iuuenum et maerentis Iuli<br>concursu, lacrimis immobilis. ille retorto<br>Paeonium in morem senior succinctus amictu<br>multa manu medica Phoebique potentibus herbis<br>nequiquam trepidat, nequiquam spicula dextra<br>sollicitat prensatque tenaci forcipe ferrum.<br>nulla uiam Fortuna regit, nihil auctor Apollo<br>subuenit, et saeuus campis magis ac magis horror<br>crebrescit propiusque malum est. iam puluere caelum<br>stare uident: subeunt equites et spicula castris<br>densa cadunt mediis. it tristis ad aethera clamor<br>bellantum iuuenum et duro sub Marte cadentum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>At this, stirred deep by her son's cruel pain, Venus his mother plucked from Cretan Ida a stalk of dittamy with downy leaves and bright-tressed flowers, the plant not unknown to wild goats when winged arrows are fast in their body. This Venus bore down, her shape girt in a dim halo; this she steeps with secret healing in the river-water poured out and sparkling abrim, and sprinkles life-giving juice of ambrosia and scented balm. With that water aged Iapix washed the wound, unwitting; and suddenly, lo! all the pain left his body, all the blood in the deep wound was stanched. And now following his hand the arrow fell out with no force, and strength returned afresh as of old. "Hasten! arms for him quickly! why stand you?" cries Iapix aloud, and begins to kindle their courage against the enemy; "this comes not by human resource or schooling of art, nor does my hand save thee, Aeneas: a higher god is at work, and sends thee back to higher deeds." He, eager for battle, had already clasped on the greaves of gold right and left, and scorning delay, brandishes his spear. When the shield is adjusted by his side and the corslet on his back, he clasps Ascanius in his armed embrace, and lightly kissing him through the helmet, cries: "Learn of me, O boy, valour and toil indeed, fortune of others. Now mine hand shall give thee defence in war, and lead thee to great reward: do thou, when hereafter thine age ripens to fulness, keep this in remembrance, and as thou recallest the pattern of thy kindred, let thy spirit rise to thy father Aeneas, thine uncle Hector." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic Venus indigno nati concussa dolore<br>dictamnum genetrix Cretaea carpit ab Ida,<br>puberibus caulem foliis et flore comantem<br>purpureo; non illa feris incognita capris<br>gramina, cum tergo uolucres haesere sagittae.<br>hoc Venus obscuro faciem circumdata nimbo<br>detulit, hoc fusum labris splendentibus amnem<br>inficit occulte medicans, spargitque salubris<br>ambrosiae sucos et odoriferam panaceam.<br>fouit ea uulnus lympha longaeuus Iapyx<br>ignorans, subitoque omnis de corpore fugit<br>quippe dolor, omnis stetit imo uulnere sanguis.<br>iamque secuta manum nullo cogente sagitta<br>excidit, atque nouae rediere in pristina uires.<br>'arma citi properate uiro! quid statis?'

The field drifts with blinding dust, and the startled earth trembles under the tramp of feet. From his earthworks opposite Turnus saw and the Ausonians saw them come, and an icy shudder ran deep through their frame; first and before all the Latins Juturna heard and knew the sound, and in terror fled away. He flies on, and hurries his dark column over the open plain. As when in fierce weather a storm-cloud moves over mid sea to land, with presaging heart, ah me, the hapless husbandmen shudder from afar; it will deal havoc to their trees and destruction to their crops, and make a broad path of ruin; the winds fly before it, and bear its roar to the beach; so the Rhoetean captain drives his army full on the foe; one and all they close up in wedges, and mass their serried ranks. Thymbraeus smites massive Osiris with the sword, Mnestheus slays Arcetius, Achates Epulo, Gyas Ufens: Tolumnius the augur himself goes down, he who had hurled the first weapon against the foe. Their cry rises to heaven, and in turn the routed Rutulians give backward in flight over the dusty fields. Himself he deigns not to cut down the fugitives, nor pursue such as meet him fair on foot or approach in arms: Turnus alone he tracks and searches in the thick haze, alone calls him to conflict. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta dedit, portis sese extulit ingens<br>telum immane manu quatiens; simul agmine denso<br>Antheusque Mnestheusque ruunt, omnisque relictis<br>turba fluit castris. tum caeco puluere campus<br>miscetur pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus.<br>uidit ab aduerso uenientis aggere Turnus,<br>uidere Ausonii, gelidusque per ima cucurrit<br>ossa tremor; prima ante omnis Iuturna Latinos<br>audiit agnouitque sonum et tremefacta refugit.<br>ille uolat campoque atrum rapit agmen aperto.<br>qualis ubi ad terras abrupto sidere nimbus<br>it mare per medium (miseris, heu, praescia longe<br>horrescunt corda agricolis: dabit ille ruinas<br>arboribus stragemque satis, ruet omnia late),<br>ante uolant sonitumque ferunt ad litora uenti:<br>talis in aduersos ductor Rhoeteius hostis<br>agmen agit, densi cuneis se quisque coactis<br>adglomerant. ferit ense grauem Thymbraeus Osirim,<br>Arcetium Mnestheus, Epulonem obtruncat Achates<br>Vfentemque Gyas; cadit ipse Tolumnius augur,<br>primus in aduersos telum qui torserat hostis.<br>tollitur in caelum clamor, uersique uicissim<br>puluerulenta fuga Rutuli dant terga per agros.<br>ipse neque auersos dignatur sternere morti<br>nec pede congressos aequo nec tela ferentis<br>insequitur: solum densa in caligine Turnum<br>uestigat lustrans, solum in certamina poscit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then panic-stricken the warrior maiden flings Turnus' charioteer out over his reins, and leaving him far where he slips from the chariot-pole, herself succeeds and turns the wavy reins, tones and limbs and armour all of Metiscus' wearing. As when a black swallow flits through some rich lord's spacious house, and circles in flight the lofty halls, gathering her tiny food for sustenance to her twittering nestlings, and now swoops down the spacious colonnades, now round the wet ponds; in like wise dart Juturna's horses amid the enemy, and her fleet chariot passes flying over all the field. And now here and now here she displays her triumphant brother, nor yet allows him to close, but flies far and away. None the less does Aeneas thread the circling maze to meet him, and tracks his man, and with loud cry cries on him through the scattered ranks. Often as he cast eyes on his enemy and essayed to outrun the speed of the flying-footed horses, so often Juturna wheeled her team away. Alas, what can he do? Vainly he tosses on the ebb and flow, and in his spirit diverse cares make conflicting call; when Messapus, who haply bore in his left hand two tough spear-shafts topped with steel, runs lightly up and aims and hurls one of them upon him with unerring stroke. Aeneas stood still, and gathered himself behind his armour, sinking on bended knee; yet the rushing spear bore off his helmet-spike, and dashed the helmet-plume from the crest. Then indeed his wrath swells; and forced to it by their treachery, while chariot and horses disappear, he calls Jove oft and again to witness, and the altars of the violated treaty, and now at last plunges amid their lines. Sweeping terrible down the tide of battle he wakens fierce indiscriminate carnage, and flings loose all the reins of wrath. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hoc concussa metu mentem Iuturna uirago<br>aurigam Turni media inter lora Metiscum<br>excutit et longe lapsum temone reliquit;<br>ipsa subit manibusque undantis flectit habenas<br>cuncta gerens, uocemque et corpus et arma Metisci.<br>nigra uelut magnas domini cum diuitis aedes<br>peruolat et pennis alta atria lustrat hirundo<br>pabula parua legens nidisque loquacibus escas,<br>et nunc porticibus uacuis, nunc umida circum<br>stagna sonat: similis medios Iuturna per hostis<br>fertur equis rapidoque uolans obit omnia curru,<br>iamque hic germanum iamque hic ostentat ouantem<br>nec conferre manum patitur, uolat auia longe.<br>haud minus Aeneas tortos legit obuius orbis,<br>uestigatque uirum et disiecta per agmina magna<br>uoce uocat. quotiens oculos coniecit in hostem<br>alipedumque fugam cursu temptauit equorum,<br>auersos totiens currus Iuturna retorsit.<br>heu, quid agat? uario nequiquam fluctuat aestu,<br>diuersaeque uocant animum in contraria curae.<br>huic Messapus, uti laeua duo forte gerebat<br>lenta, leuis cursu, praefixa hastilia ferro,<br>horum unum certo contorquens derigit ictu.<br>substitit Aeneas et se collegit in arma<br>poplite subsidens; apicem tamen incita summum<br>hasta tulit summasque excussit uertice cristas.<br>tum uero adsurgunt irae, insidiisque subactus,<br>diuersos ubi sensit equos currumque referri,<br>multa Iouem et laesi testatus foederis aras<br>iam tandem inuadit medios et Marte secundo<br>terribilis saeuam nullo discrimine caedem<br>suscitat, irarumque omnis effundit habenas.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>What god may now unfold for me in verse so many woes, so many diverse slaughters and death of captains whom now Turnus, now again the Trojan hero, drives over all the field? Was it well, O God, that nations destined to everlasting peace should clash in so vast a shock? Aeneas meets Sucro the Rutulian; the combat stayed the first rush of the Teucrians, but delayed them not long; he catches him on the side, and, when fate comes quickest, drives the harsh sword clean through the ribs where they fence the breast. Turnus brings down Amycus from horseback with his brother Diores, and meets them on foot; him he strikes with his long spear as he comes, him with his sword-point, and hangs both severed heads on his chariot and carries them off dripping with blood. The one sends to death Talos and Tanaïs and brave Cethegus, three at one meeting, and gloomy Onites, of Echionian name, and Peridia the mother that bore him; the other those brethren sent from Lycia and Apollo's fields, and Menoetes the Arcadian, him who loathed warfare in vain; who once had his art and humble home about the river-fisheries of Lerna, and knew not the courts of the great, but his father was tenant of the land he tilled. And as fires kindled dispersedly in a dry forest and rustling laurel-thickets, or foaming rivers where they leap swift and loud from high hills, and speed to sea each in his own path of havoc; as fiercely the two, Aeneas and Turnus, dash amid the battle; now, now wrath surges within them, and unconquerable hearts are torn; now in all their might they rush upon wounds. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Quis mihi nunc tot acerba deus, quis carmine caedes<br>diuersas obitumque ducum, quos aequore toto<br>inque uicem nunc Turnus agit, nunc Troius heros,<br>expediat? tanton placuit concurrere motu,<br>Iuppiter, aeterna gentis in pace futuras?<br>Aeneas Rutulum Sucronem (ea prima ruentis<br>pugna loco statuit Teucros) haud multa morantem<br>excipit in latus et, qua fata celerrima, crudum<br>transadigit costas et cratis pectoris ensem.<br>Turnus equo deiectum Amycum fratremque Dioren,<br>congressus pedes, hunc uenientem cuspide longa,<br>hunc mucrone ferit, curruque abscisa duorum<br>suspendit capita et rorantia sanguine portat.<br>ille Talon Tanaimque neci fortemque Cethegum,<br>tris uno congressu, et maestum mittit Oniten,<br>nomen Echionium matrisque genus Peridiae;<br>hic fratres Lycia missos et Apollinis agris<br>et iuuenem exosum nequiquam bella Menoeten,<br>Arcada, piscosae cui circum flumina Lernae<br>ars fuerat pauperque domus nec nota potentum<br>munera, conductaque pater tellure serebat.<br>ac uelut immissi diuersis partibus ignes<br>arentem in siluam et uirgulta sonantia lauro,<br>aut ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis<br>dant sonitum spumosi amnes et in aequora currunt<br>quisque suum populatus iter: non segnius ambo<br>Aeneas Turnusque ruunt per proelia; nunc, nunc<br>fluctuat ira intus, rumpuntur nescia uinci<br>pectora, nunc totis in uulnera uiribus itur.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The one dashes Murranus down and stretches him on the soil with a vast whirling mass of rock, as he cries the names of his fathers and forefathers of old, a whole line drawn through Latin kings; under traces and yoke the wheels spurned him, and the fast-beating hoofs of his rushing horses trample down their forgotten lord. The other meets Hyllus rushing on in gigantic pride, and hurls his weapon at his gold-bound temples; the spear pierced through the helmet and stood fast in the brain. Neither did thy right hand save thee from Turnus, O Cretheus, bravest of the Greeks; nor did his gods shield Cupencus when Aeneas came; he gave his breast full to the steel, nor, alas! was the brazen shield's delay aught of avail. Thee likewise, Aeolus, the Laurentine plains saw sink backward and cover a wide space of earth; thou fallest, whom Argive battalions could not lay low, nor Achilles the destroyer of Priam's realm. Here was thy goal of death; thine high house was under Ida, at Lyrnesus thine high house, on Laurentine soil thy tomb. The whole battle-lines gather up, all Latium and all Dardania, Mnestheus and valiant Serestus, with Messapus, tamer of horses, and brave Asilas, the Tuscan battalion and Evander's Arcadian squadrons; man by man they struggle with all their might; no rest nor pause in the vast strain of conflict. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Murranum hic, atauos et auorum antiqua sonantem<br>nomina per regesque actum genus omne Latinos,<br>praecipitem scopulo atque ingentis turbine saxi<br>excutit effunditque solo; hunc lora et iuga subter<br>prouoluere rotae, crebro super ungula pulsu<br>incita nec domini memorum proculcat equorum.<br>ille ruenti Hyllo animisque immane frementi<br>occurrit telumque aurata ad tempora torquet:<br>olli per galeam fixo stetit hasta cerebro.<br>dextera nec tua te, Graium fortissime Cretheu,<br>eripuit Turno, nec di texere Cupencum<br>Aenea ueniente sui: dedit obuia ferro<br>pectora, nec misero clipei mora profuit aerei.<br>te quoque Laurentes uiderunt, Aeole, campi<br>oppetere et late terram consternere tergo.<br>occidis, Argiuae quem non potuere phalanges<br>sternere nec Priami regnorum euersor Achilles;<br>hic tibi mortis erant metae, domus alta sub Ida,<br>Lyrnesi domus alta, solo Laurente sepulcrum.<br>totae adeo conuersae acies omnesque Latini,<br>omnes Dardanidae, Mnestheus acerque Serestus<br>et Messapus equum domitor et fortis Asilas<br>Tuscorumque phalanx Euandrique Arcades alae,<br>pro se quisque uiri summa nituntur opum ui;<br>nec mora nec requies, uasto certamine tendunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>At this Aeneas' mother most beautiful inspired him to advance on the walls, directing his columns on the town and dismaying the Latins with sudden and swift disaster. As in search for Turnus he bent his glance this way and that round the separate ranks, he descries the city free from all this warfare, unpunished and unstirred. Straightway he kindles at the view of a greater battle; he summons Mnestheus and Sergestus and brave Serestus his captains, and mounts a hillock; there the rest of the Teucrian army gathers thickly, still grasping shield and spear. Standing on the high mound amid them, he speaks: "Be there no delay to my words; Jupiter is with us; neither let any be slower to move that the design is sudden. This city to-day, the source of war, the royal seat of Latinus, unless they yield them to receive our yoke and obey their conquerors, will I raze to ground, and lay her smoking roofs level with the dust. Must I wait forsooth till Turnus please to stoop to combat, and choose again to face his conqueror? This, O citizens, is the fountain-head and crown of the accursed war. Bring brands speedily, and reclaim the treaty in fire." He ended; all with spirit alike emulous form a wedge and advance in serried masses to the walls. Ladders are run up, and fire leaps sudden to sight. Some rush to the separate gates, and cut down the guards of the entry, others hurl their steel and darken the sky with weapons. Aeneas himself among the foremost, upstretching his hand to the city walls, loudly reproaches Latinus, and takes the gods to witness that he is again forced into battle, that twice now do the Italians choose warfare and break a second treaty. Discord rises among the alarmed citizens: some bid unbar the town and fling wide their gates to the Dardanians, and pull the king himself towards the ramparts; others bring arms and hasten to defend the walls: as when a shepherd tracks bees to their retreat in a recessed rock, and fills it with stinging smoke, they within run uneasily up and down their waxen fortress, and hum louder in rising wrath; the smell rolls in darkness along their dwelling, and a blind murmur echoes within the rock as the smoke issues to the empty air. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic mentem Aeneae genetrix pulcherrima misit<br>iret ut ad muros urbique aduerteret agmen<br>ocius et subita turbaret clade Latinos.<br>ille ut uestigans diuersa per agmina Turnum<br>huc atque huc acies circumtulit, aspicit urbem<br>immunem tanti belli atque impune quietam.<br>continuo pugnae accendit maioris imago:<br>Mnesthea Sergestumque uocat fortemque Serestum<br>ductores, tumulumque capit quo cetera Teucrum<br>concurrit legio, nec scuta aut spicula densi<br>deponunt. celso medius stans aggere fatur:<br>'ne qua meis esto dictis mora, Iuppiter hac stat,<br>neu quis ob inceptum subitum mihi segnior ito.<br>urbem hodie, causam belli, regna ipsa Latini,<br>ni frenum accipere et uicti parere fatentur,<br>eruam et aequa solo fumantia culmina ponam.<br>scilicet exspectem libeat dum proelia Turno<br>nostra pati rursusque uelit concurrere uictus?<br>hoc caput, o ciues, haec belli summa nefandi.<br>ferte faces propere foedusque reposcite flammis.'<br>dixerat, atque animis pariter certantibus omnes<br>dant cuneum densaque ad muros mole feruntur;<br>scalae improuiso subitusque apparuit ignis.<br>discurrunt alii ad portas primosque trucidant,<br>ferrum alii torquent et obumbrant aethera telis.<br>ipse inter primos dextram sub moenia tendit<br>Aeneas, magnaque incusat uoce Latinum<br>testaturque deos iterum se ad proelia cogi,<br>bis iam Italos hostis, haec altera foedera rumpi.<br>exoritur trepidos inter discordia ciuis:<br>urbem alii reserare iubent et pandere portas<br>Dardanidis ipsumque trahunt in moenia regem;<br>arma ferunt alii et pergunt defendere muros,<br>inclusas ut cum latebroso in pumice pastor<br>uestigauit apes fumoque impleuit amaro;<br>illae intus trepidae rerum per cerea castra<br>discurrunt magnisque acuunt stridoribus iras;<br>uoluitur ater odor tectis, tum murmure caeco<br>intus saxa sonant, uacuas it fumus ad auras.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This fortune likewise befell the despairing Latins, this woe shook the whole city to her base. The queen espies from her roof the enemy's approach, the walls scaled and firebrands flying on the houses; and nowhere Rutulian ranks, none of Turnus' columns to meet them; alas! she deems him destroyed in the shock of battle, and, distracted by sudden anguish, shrieks that she is the source of guilt, the spring of ill, and with many a mad utterance of frenzied grief rends her purple attire with dying hand, and ties from a lofty beam the ghastly noose of death. And when the unhappy Latin women knew this calamity, first her daughter Lavinia tears her flower-like tresses and roseate cheeks, and all the train around her madden in her suit; the wide palace echoes to their wailing, and from it the sorrowful rumour spreads abroad throughout the town. All hearts sink; Latinus goes with torn raiment, in dismay at his wife's doom and his city's downfall, defiling his hoary hair with soilure of sprinkled dust. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Accidit haec fessis etiam fortuna Latinis,<br>quae totam luctu concussit funditus urbem.<br>regina ut tectis uenientem prospicit hostem,<br>incessi muros, ignis ad tecta uolare,<br>nusquam acies contra Rutulas, nulla agmina Turni,<br>infelix pugnae iuuenem in certamine credit<br>exstinctum et subito mentem turbata dolore<br>se causam clamat crimenque caputque malorum,<br>multaque per maestum demens effata furorem<br>purpureos moritura manu discindit amictus<br>et nodum informis leti trabe nectit ab alta.<br>quam cladem miserae postquam accepere Latinae,<br>filia prima manu flauos Lauinia crinis<br>et roseas laniata genas, tum cetera circum<br>turba furit, resonant late plangoribus aedes.<br>hinc totam infelix uulgatur fama per urbem:<br>demittunt mentes, it scissa ueste Latinus<br>coniugis attonitus fatis urbisque ruina,<br>canitiem immundo perfusam puluere turpans.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile on the skirts of the field Turnus chases scattered stragglers, ever slacker to battle, ever less and less exultant in his coursers' victorious speed. The confused cry came to him borne in blind terror down the breeze, and his startled ears caught the echoing tumult and disastrous murmur of the town. "Ah me! what agony shakes the city? or what is this cry that fleets so loud from the distant town?" So speaks he, and distractedly checks the reins. And to him his sister, as changed into his charioteer Metiscus' likeness she swayed horses and chariot-reins, thus rejoined: "This way, Turnus, let us pursue the brood of Troy, where victory opens her nearest way; there are others whose hands can protect their dwellings. Aeneas falls fiercer on the Italians, and closes in conflict; let our hand too deal pitiless death on his Teucrians. Neither in tale of dead nor in glory of battle shalt thou retire outdone."

Before my very eyes, calling aloud on me, I saw Murranus, than whom none other is left me more dear, sink huge to earth, borne down by as huge a wound. Hapless Ufens is fallen, not to see our shame; corpse and armour are in Teucrian hands. The destruction of their households, this was the one thing yet lacking; shall I suffer it? Shall my hand not refute Drances' jeers? shall I turn my back, and this land see Turnus a fugitive? Is Death all so bitter?

Saces, borne flying on his foaming horse through the thickest of the foe, an arrow-wound right in his face, darts, beseeching Turnus by his name. "Turnus, in thee is our last safety; pity thy people. Aeneas thunders in arms, and threatens to overthrow and hurl to destruction the high Italian fortress; and already firebrands are flying on our roofs. On thee, on thee the Latins turn their gazing eyes; King Latinus himself mutters in doubt, whom he is to call his sons, to whom he shall incline in union. Moreover the queen, thy surest stay, hath fallen by her own hand and in dismay fled the light. Alone in front of the gates Messapus and valiant Atinas sustain the battle-line. Round about them to right and left the armies stand locked and the iron field shivers with naked points; thou wheelest thy chariot on the sward alone." At the distracting picture of his fortune Turnus froze in horror and stood in dumb gaze; together in his heart sweep the vast mingling tides of shame and maddened grief, and love stung to frenzy and resolved valour. So soon as the darkness cleared and light returned to his soul, he fiercely turned his blazing eyeballs towards the ramparts, and gazed back from his wheels on the great city. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vix ea fatus erat: medios uolat ecce per hostis<br>uectus equo spumante Saces, aduersa sagitta<br>saucius ora, ruitque implorans nomine Turnum:<br>'Turne, in te suprema salus, miserere tuorum.<br>fulminat Aeneas armis summasque minatur<br>deiecturum arces Italum excidioque daturum,<br>iamque faces ad tecta uolant. in te ora Latini,<br>in te oculos referunt; mussat rex ipse Latinus<br>quos generos uocet aut quae sese ad foedera flectat.<br>praeterea regina, tui fidissima, dextra<br>occidit ipsa sua lucemque exterrita fugit.<br>soli pro portis Messapus et acer Atinas<br>sustentant acies. circum hos utrimque phalanges<br>stant densae strictisque seges mucronibus horret<br>ferrea; tu currum deserto in gramine uersas.'<br>obstipuit uaria confusus imagine rerum<br>Turnus et obtutu tacito stetit; aestuat ingens<br>uno in corde pudor mixtoque insania luctu<br>et furiis agitatus amor et conscia uirtus.<br>ut primum discussae umbrae et lux reddita menti,<br>ardentis oculorum orbis ad moenia torsit<br>turbidus eque rotis magnam respexit ad urbem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And lo! a spire of flame wreathing through the floors wavered up skyward and held a turret fast, a turret that he himself had reared of mortised planks and set on rollers and laid with high gangways. "Now, O my sister, now fate prevails: cease to hinder; let us follow where deity and stern fortune call. I am resolved to face Aeneas, resolved to bear what bitterness there is in death; nor shalt thou longer see me shamed, sister of mine. Let me be mad, I pray thee, with this madness before the end." He spoke, and leapt swiftly from his chariot to the field, and darting through weapons and through enemies, leaves his sorrowing sister, and bursts in rapid course amid their columns. And as when a rock rushes headlong from some mountain peak, torn away by the blast, or if the rushing rain washes it away, or the stealing years loosen its ancient hold; the reckless mountain mass goes sheer and impetuous, and leaps along the ground, hurling with it forests and herds and men; thus through the scattering columns Turnus rushes to the city walls, where the earth is wettest with bloodshed and the air sings with spears; and beckons with his hand, and thus begins aloud: "Forbear now, O Rutulians, and you, Latins, stay your weapons. Whatsoever fortune is left is mine: I singly must expiate the treaty for you all, and make decision with the sword." All drew aside and left him room. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ecce autem flammis inter tabulata uolutus<br>ad caelum undabat uertex turrimque tenebat,<br>turrim compactis trabibus quam eduxerat ipse<br>subdideratque rotas pontisque instrauerat altos.<br>'iam iam fata, soror, superant, absiste morari;<br>quo deus et quo dura uocat Fortuna sequamur.<br>stat conferre manum Aeneae, stat, quidquid acerbi est,<br>morte pati, neque me indecorem, germana, uidebis<br>amplius. hunc, oro, sine me furere ante furorem.'<br>dixit, et e curru saltum dedit ocius aruis<br>perque hostis, per tela ruit maestamque sororem<br>deserit ac rapido cursu media agmina rumpit.<br>ac ueluti montis saxum de uertice praeceps<br>cum ruit auulsum uento, seu turbidus imber<br>proluit aut annis soluit sublapsa uetustas;<br>fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu<br>exsultatque solo, siluas armenta uirosque<br>inuoluens secum: disiecta per agmina Turnus<br>sic urbis ruit ad muros, ubi plurima fuso<br>sanguine terra madet striduntque hastilibus aurae,<br>significatque manu et magno simul incipit ore:<br>'parcite iam, Rutuli, et uos tela inhibete, Latini.<br>quaecumque est fortuna, mea est; me uerius unum<br>pro uobis foedus luere et decernere ferro.'<br>discessere omnes medii spatiumque dedere.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But lord Aeneas, hearing Turnus' name, abandons the walls, abandons the fortress height, and in exultant joy flings aside all hindrance, breaks off all work, and clashes his armour terribly, vast as Athos, or as Eryx, or as the lord of Apennine when he roars with his tossing ilex woods and rears his snowy crest rejoicing into air. Now indeed Rutulians and Trojans and all Italy turned in emulous gaze, and they who held the high city, and they whose ram was battering the foundations of the wall, and unarmed their shoulders. Latinus himself stands in amaze at the mighty men, born in distant quarters of the world, met and making decision with the sword. And they, in the empty level field that cleared for them, darted swiftly forward, and hurling their spears from far, close in battle shock with clangour of brazen shields. Earth utters a moan; the sword-strokes fall thick and fast, chance and valour joining in one. And as in broad Sila or high on Taburnus, when two bulls rush to deadly battle forehead to forehead, the herdsmen retire in terror, all the herd stands dumb in dismay, and the heifers murmur in doubt which shall be lord in the woodland, which all the cattle must follow; they violently deal many a mutual wound, and gore with their stubborn horns, bathing their necks and shoulders in abundant blood; all the woodland moans back their bellowing: even thus Aeneas of Troy and the Daunian hero rush together shield to shield; the mighty crash fills the sky. Jupiter himself holds up the two scales in even balance, and lays in them the different fates of both, trying which shall pay forfeit of the strife, whose weight shall sink in death. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At pater Aeneas audito nomine Turni<br>deserit et muros et summas deserit arces<br>praecipitatque moras omnis, opera omnia rumpit<br>laetitia exsultans horrendumque intonat armis:<br>quantus Athos aut quantus Eryx aut ipse coruscis<br>cum fremit ilicibus quantus gaudetque niuali<br>uertice se attollens pater Appenninus ad auras.<br>iam uero et Rutuli certatim et Troes et omnes<br>conuertere oculos Itali, quique alta tenebant<br>moenia quique imos pulsabant ariete muros,<br>armaque deposuere umeris. stupet ipse Latinus<br>ingentis, genitos diuersis partibus orbis,<br>inter se coiisse uiros et cernere ferro.<br>atque illi, ut uacuo patuerunt aequore campi,<br>procursu rapido coniectis eminus hastis<br>inuadunt Martem clipeis atque aere sonoro.<br>dat gemitum tellus; tum crebros ensibus ictus<br>congeminant, fors et uirtus miscetur in unum.<br>ac uelut ingenti Sila summoue Taburno<br>cum duo conuersis inimica in proelia tauri<br>frontibus incurrunt, pauidi cessere magistri,<br>stat pecus omne metu mutum, mussantque iuuencae<br>quis nemori imperitet, quem tota armenta sequantur;<br>illi inter sese multa ui uulnera miscent<br>cornuaque obnixi infigunt et sanguine largo<br>colla armosque lauant, gemitu nemus omne remugit:<br>non aliter Tros Aeneas et Daunius heros<br>concurrunt clipeis, ingens fragor aethera complet.<br>Iuppiter ipse duas aequato examine lances<br>sustinet et fata imponit diuersa duorum,<br>quem damnet labor et quo uergat pondere letum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Turnus darts out, thinking it secure, and rises with his whole reach of body on his uplifted sword; then strikes; Trojans and Latins cry out in excitement, and both armies strain their gaze. But the treacherous sword shivers, and in mid stroke deserts its eager lord. If flight aid him not now! He flies swifter than the wind, when once he descries a strange hilt in his weaponless hand. Rumour is that in his headlong hurry, when mounting behind his yoked horses to begin the battle, he left his father's sword behind and caught up his charioteer Metiscus' weapon; and that served him long, while Teucrian stragglers turned their backs; when it met the divine Vulcanian armour, the mortal blade like brittle ice snapped in the stroke; the shards lie glittering upon the yellow sand. So in distracted flight Turnus darts afar over the plain, and now this way and now that crosses in wavering circles; for on all hands the Teucrians locked him in crowded ring, and the dreary marsh on this side, on this the steep city ramparts hem him in. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Emicat hic impune putans et corpore toto<br>alte sublatum consurgit Turnus in ensem<br>et ferit; exclamant Troes trepidique Latini,<br>arrectaeque amborum acies. at perfidus ensis<br>frangitur in medioque ardentem deserit ictu,<br>ni fuga subsidio subeat. fugit ocior Euro<br>ut capulum ignotum dextramque aspexit inermem.<br>fama est praecipitem, cum prima in proelia iunctos<br>conscendebat equos, patrio mucrone relicto,<br>dum trepidat, ferrum aurigae rapuisse Metisci;<br>idque diu, dum terga dabant palantia Teucri,<br>suffecit; postquam arma dei ad Volcania uentum est,<br>mortalis mucro glacies ceu futtilis ictu<br>dissiluit, fulua resplendent fragmina harena.<br>ergo amens diuersa fuga petit aequora Turnus<br>et nunc huc, inde huc incertos implicat orbis;<br>undique enim densa Teucri inclusere corona<br>atque hinc uasta palus, hinc ardua moenia cingunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Therewith Aeneas pursues, though ever and anon his knees, disabled by the arrow, hinder and stay his speed; and foot hard on foot presses hotly on his hurrying enemy: as when a hunter courses with a fleet barking hound some stag caught in a river-loop or girt by the crimson-feathered toils, and he, in terror of the snares and the high river-bank, darts back and forward in a thousand ways; but the keen Umbrian clings agape, and just catches at him, and as though he caught him snaps his jaws while the baffled teeth close on vacancy. Then indeed a cry goes up, and banks and pools answer round about, and all the sky echoes the din. He, even as he flies, chides all his Rutulians, calling each by name, and shrieks for the sword he knew. But Aeneas denounces death and instant doom if one of them draw nigh, and doubles their terror with threats of their city's destruction, and though wounded presses on. Five circles they cover at full speed, and unwind as many this way and that; for not light nor slight is the prize they seek, but Turnus' very lifeblood is at issue. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nec minus Aeneas, quamquam tardata sagitta<br>interdum genua impediunt cursumque recusant,<br>insequitur trepidique pedem pede feruidus urget:<br>inclusum ueluti si quando flumine nactus<br>ceruum aut puniceae saeptum formidine pennae<br>uenator cursu canis et latratibus instat;<br>ille autem insidiis et ripa territus alta<br>mille fugit refugitque uias, at uiuidus Vmber<br>haeret hians, iam iamque tenet similisque tenenti<br>increpuit malis morsuque elusus inani est;<br>tum uero exoritur clamor ripaeque lacusque<br>responsant circa et caelum tonat omne tumultu.<br>ille simul fugiens Rutulos simul increpat omnis<br>nomine quemque uocans notumque efflagitat ensem.<br>Aeneas mortem contra praesensque minatur<br>exitium, si quisquam adeat, terretque trementis<br>excisurum urbem minitans et saucius instat.<br>quinque orbis explent cursu totidemque retexunt<br>huc illuc; neque enim leuia aut ludicra petuntur<br>praemia, sed Turni de uita et sanguine certant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Here there haply had stood a bitter-leaved wild olive, sacred to Faunus, a tree worshipped by mariners of old; on it, when rescued from the waves, they were wont to fix their gifts to the god of Laurentum and hang their votive raiment; but the Teucrians, unregarding, had cleared away the sacred stem, that they might meet on unimpeded lists. Here stood Aeneas' spear; hither borne by its own speed it was held fast stuck in the tough root. The Dardanian stooped over it, and would wrench away the steel, to follow with the weapon him whom he could not catch in running. Then indeed Turnus cries in frantic terror: "Faunus, have pity, I beseech thee! and thou, most gracious Earth, keep thy hold on the steel, as I ever have kept your worship, and the Aeneadae again have polluted it in war." He spoke, and called the god to aid in vows that fell not fruitless. For all Aeneas' strength, his long struggling and delay over the tough stem availed not to unclose the hard grip of the wood. While he strains and pulls hard, the Daunian goddess, changing once more into the charioteer Metiscus' likeness, runs forward and passes her brother his sword. But Venus, indignant that the Nymph might be so bold, drew nigh and wrenched away the spear where it stuck deep in the root. Erect in fresh courage and arms, he with his faithful sword, he towering fierce over his spear, they face one another panting in the battle shock. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Forte sacer Fauno foliis oleaster amaris<br>hic steterat, nautis olim uenerabile lignum,<br>seruati ex undis ubi figere dona solebant<br>Laurenti diuo et uotas suspendere uestis;<br>sed stirpem Teucri nullo discrimine sacrum<br>sustulerant, puro ut possent concurrere campo.<br>hic hasta Aeneae stabat, huc impetus illam<br>detulerat fixam et lenta radice tenebat.<br>incubuit uoluitque manu conuellere ferrum<br>Dardanides, teloque sequi quem prendere cursu<br>non poterat. tum uero amens formidine Turnus<br>'Faune, precor, miserere' inquit 'tuque optima ferrum<br>Terra tene, colui uestros si semper honores,<br>quos contra Aeneadae bello fecere profanos.'<br>dixit, opemque dei non cassa in uota uocauit.<br>namque diu luctans lentoque in stirpe moratus<br>uiribus haud ullis ualuit discludere morsus<br>roboris Aeneas. dum nititur acer et instat,<br>rursus in aurigae faciem mutata Metisci<br>procurrit fratrique ensem dea Daunia reddit.<br>quod Venus audaci nymphae indignata licere<br>accessit telumque alta ab radice reuellit.<br>olli sublimes armis animisque refecti,<br>hic gladio fidens, hic acer et arduus hasta,<br>adsistunt contra certamina Martis anheli.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile the King of Heaven's omnipotence accosts Juno as she gazes on the battle from a sunlit cloud.

Thus Jupiter began: thus the goddess, daughter of Saturn, returned with looks cast down: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iunonem interea rex omnipotentis Olympi<br>adloquitur fulua pugnas de nube tuentem:<br>'quae iam finis erit, coniunx? quid denique restat?<br>indigetem Aenean scis ipsa et scire fateris<br>deberi caelo fatisque ad sidera tolli.<br>quid struis? aut qua spe gelidis in nubibus haeres?<br>mortalin decuit uiolari uulnere diuum?<br>aut ensem (quid enim sine te Iuturna ualeret?)<br>ereptum reddi Turno et uim crescere uictis?<br>desine iam tandem precibusque inflectere nostris,<br>ne te tantus edit tacitam dolor et mihi curae<br>saepe tuo dulci tristes ex ore recursent.<br>uentum ad supremum est. terris agitare uel undis<br>Troianos potuisti, infandum accendere bellum,<br>deformare domum et luctu miscere hymenaeos:<br>ulterius temptare ueto.' sic Iuppiter orsus;<br>sic dea summisso contra Saturnia uultu:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Even because this thy will, great Jupiter, is known to me for thine, have I left, though loth, Turnus alone on earth; nor else wouldst thou see me now, alone on this skyey seat, enduring good and bad; but girt in flame I were standing by their very lines, and dragging the Teucrians into the deadly battle. I counselled Juturna, I confess it, to succour her hapless brother, and for his life's sake favoured a greater daring; yet not the arrow-shot, not the bending of the bow, I swear by the merciless well-head of the Stygian spring, the single ordained dread of the gods in heaven. And now I retire, and leave the battle in loathing. This thing I beseech thee, that is bound by no fatal law, for Latium and for the majesty of thy kindred. When now they shall plight peace with prosperous marriages (be it so!), when now they shall join in laws and treaties, bid thou not the native Latins change their name of old, nor become Trojans and take the Teucrian name, or change their language, or alter their attire: let Latium be, let Alban kings endure through ages, let Italian valour be potent in the race of Rome. Troy is fallen; let her and her name lie where they fell." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'ista quidem quia nota mihi tua, magne, uoluntas,<br>Iuppiter, et Turnum et terras inuita reliqui;<br>nec tu me aeria solam nunc sede uideres<br>digna indigna pati, sed flammis cincta sub ipsa<br>starem acie traheremque inimica in proelia Teucros.<br>Iuturnam misero (fateor) succurrere fratri<br>suasi et pro uita maiora audere probaui,<br>non ut tela tamen, non ut contenderet arcum;<br>adiuro Stygii caput implacabile fontis,<br>una superstitio superis quae reddita diuis.<br>et nunc cedo equidem pugnasque exosa relinquo.<br>illud te, nulla fati quod lege tenetur,<br>pro Latio obtestor, pro maiestate tuorum:<br>cum iam conubiis pacem felicibus (esto)<br>component, cum iam leges et foedera iungent,<br>ne uetus indigenas nomen mutare Latinos<br>neu Troas fieri iubeas Teucrosque uocari<br>aut uocem mutare uiros aut uertere uestem.<br>sit Latium, sint Albani per saecula reges,<br>sit Romana potens Itala uirtute propago:<br>occidit, occideritque sinas cum nomine Troia.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>To her smilingly the designer of men and things: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">olli subridens hominum rerumque repertor:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Jove's own sister thou art, and second seed of Saturn, such surge of wrath tosses within thy breast! But come, allay this madness so vainly stirred. I give thee thy will, and yield thee ungrudged victory. Ausonia shall keep her native speech and usage, and as her name is, it shall be. The Trojans shall sink mingling into their blood; I will add their sacred law and ritual, and make all Latins and of a single speech. Hence shall spring a race of tempered Ausonian blood, whom thou shalt see outdo men and gods in duty; nor shall any nation so observe thy worship." To this Juno assented, and in gladness withdrew her purpose; meanwhile she quits her cloud, and retires out of the sky. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'es germana Iouis Saturnique altera proles,<br>irarum tantos uoluis sub pectore fluctus.<br>uerum age et inceptum frustra summitte furorem:<br>do quod uis, et me uictusque uolensque remitto.<br>sermonem Ausonii patrium moresque tenebunt,<br>utque est nomen erit; commixti corpore tantum<br>subsident Teucri. morem ritusque sacrorum<br>adiciam faciamque omnis uno ore Latinos.<br>hinc genus Ausonio mixtum quod sanguine surget,<br>supra homines, supra ire deos pietate uidebis,<br>nec gens ulla tuos aeque celebrabit honores.'<br>adnuit his Iuno et mentem laetata retorsit;<br>interea excedit caelo nubemque relinquit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This done, the Father revolves inly another counsel, and prepares to separate Juturna from her brother's arms. Twin monsters there are, called the Dirae by their name, whom with infernal Megaera the dead of night bore at one single birth, and wreathed them in like serpent coils, and clothed them in windy wings. They appear at Jove's throne and in the courts of the grim king, and quicken the terrors of wretched men whensoever the lord of heaven deals sicknesses and dreadful death, or sends terror of war upon guilty cities. One of these Jupiter sent swiftly down from heaven's height, and bade her meet Juturna for a sign. She wings her way, and darts in a whirlwind to earth. Even as an arrow through a cloud, darting from the string when Parthian hath poisoned it with bitter gall, Parthian or Cydonian, and sped the immedicable shaft, leaps through the swift shadow whistling and unknown; so sprung and swept to earth the daughter of Night. When she espies the Ilian ranks and Turnus' columns, suddenly shrinking to the shape of a small bird that often sits late by night on tombs or ruinous roofs, and vexes the darkness with her cry, in such change of likeness the monster shrilly passes and repasses before Turnus' face, and her wings beat restlessly on his shield. A strange numbing terror unnerves his limbs, his hair thrills up, and the accents falter on his tongue. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">His actis aliud genitor secum ipse uolutat<br>Iuturnamque parat fratris dimittere ab armis.<br>dicuntur geminae pestes cognomine Dirae,<br>quas et Tartaream Nox intempesta Megaeram<br>uno eodemque tulit partu, paribusque reuinxit<br>serpentum spiris uentosasque addidit alas.<br>hae Iouis ad solium saeuique in limine regis<br>apparent acuuntque metum mortalibus aegris,<br>si quando letum horrificum morbosque deum rex<br>molitur, meritas aut bello territat urbes.<br>harum unam celerem demisit ab aethere summo<br>Iuppiter inque omen Iuturnae occurrere iussit:<br>illa uolat celerique ad terram turbine fertur.<br>non secus ac neruo per nubem impulsa sagitta,<br>armatam saeui Parthus quam felle ueneni,<br>Parthus siue Cydon, telum immedicabile, torsit,<br>stridens et celeris incognita transilit umbras:<br>talis se sata Nocte tulit terrasque petiuit.<br>postquam acies uidet Iliacas atque agmina Turni,<br>alitis in paruae subitam collecta figuram,<br>quae quondam in bustis aut culminibus desertis<br>nocte sedens serum canit importuna per umbras—<br>hanc uersa in faciem Turni se pestis ob ora<br>fertque refertque sonans clipeumque euerberat alis.<br>illi membra nouus soluit formidine torpor,<br>arrectaeque horrore comae et uox faucibus haesit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But when his hapless sister knew afar the whistling wings of the Fury, Juturna unbinds and tears her tresses, with rent face and smitten bosom. "How, O Turnus, can thine own sister help thee now? or what more is there if I break not under this? What art of mine can lengthen out thy day? can I contend with this ominous thing? Now, now I quit the field. Dismay not my terrors, disastrous birds; I know these beating wings, and the sound of death, nor do I miss high-hearted Jove's haughty ordinance. Is this his repayment for my maidenhood? what good is his gift of life for ever? why have I forfeited a mortal's lot? Now assuredly could I make all this pain cease, and go with my unhappy brother side by side into the dark. Alas mine immortality! will aught of mine be sweet to me without thee, my brother? Ah, how may Earth yawn deep enough for me, and plunge my godhead in the under world!" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At procul ut Dirae stridorem agnouit et alas,<br>infelix crinis scindit Iuturna solutos<br>unguibus ora soror foedans et pectora pugnis:<br>'quid nunc te tua, Turne, potest germana iuuare?<br>aut quid iam durae superat mihi? qua tibi lucem<br>arte morer? talin possum me opponere monstro?<br>iam iam linquo acies. ne me terrete timentem,<br>obscenae uolucres: alarum uerbera nosco<br>letalemque sonum, nec fallunt iussa superba<br>magnanimi Iouis. haec pro uirginitate reponit?<br>quo uitam dedit aeternam? cur mortis adempta est<br>condicio? possem tantos finire dolores<br>nunc certe, et misero fratri comes ire per umbras!<br>immortalis ego? aut quicquam mihi dulce meorum<br>te sine, frater, erit? o quae satis ima dehiscat<br>terra mihi, Manisque deam demittat ad imos?'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So spoke she, and wrapping her head in her gray vesture, the goddess moaning sore sank in the river depth. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">tantum effata caput glauco contexit amictu<br>multa gemens et se fluuio dea condidit alto.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But Aeneas presses on, brandishing his vast tree-like spear, and fiercely speaks thus: "What more delay is there now? or why, Turnus, dost thou yet shrink away? Not in speed of foot, in grim arms, hand to hand, must be the conflict. Transform thyself as thou wilt, and collect what strength of courage or skill is thine; pray that thou mayest wing thy flight to the stars on high, or that sheltering earth may shut thee in." The other, shaking his head: "Thy fierce words dismay me not, insolent! the gods dismay me, and Jupiter's enmity." And no more said, his eyes light on a vast stone, a stone ancient and vast that haply lay upon the plain, set for a landmark to divide contested fields: scarcely might twelve chosen men lift it on their shoulders, of such frame as now earth brings to birth: then the hero caught it up with trembling hand and whirled it at the foe, rising higher and quickening his speed. But he knows not his own self running nor going nor lifting his hands or moving the mighty stone; his knees totter, his blood freezes cold; the very stone he hurls, spinning through the empty void, neither wholly reached its distance nor carried its blow home. And as in sleep, when nightly rest weighs down our languorous eyes, we seem vainly to will to run eagerly on, and sink faint amidst our struggles; the tongue is powerless, the familiar strength fails the body, nor will words or utterance follow: so the disastrous goddess brings to naught all Turnus' valour as he presses on. His heart wavers in shifting emotion; he gazes on his Rutulians and on the city, and falters in terror, and shudders at the imminent spear; neither sees he whither he may escape nor how rush violently on the enemy, and nowhere his chariot or his sister at the reins. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeneas instat contra telumque coruscat<br>ingens arboreum, et saeuo sic pectore fatur:<br>'quae nunc deinde mora est? aut quid iam, Turne, retractas?<br>non cursu, saeuis certandum est comminus armis.<br>uerte omnis tete in facies et contrahe quidquid<br>siue animis siue arte uales; opta ardua pennis<br>astra sequi clausumque caua te condere terra.'<br>ille caput quassans: 'non me tua feruida terrent<br>dicta, ferox; di me terrent et Iuppiter hostis.'<br>nec plura effatus saxum circumspicit ingens,<br>saxum antiquum ingens, campo quod forte iacebat,<br>limes agro positus litem ut discerneret aruis.<br>uix illum lecti bis sex ceruice subirent,<br>qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus;<br>ille manu raptum trepida torquebat in hostem<br>altior insurgens et cursu concitus heros.<br>sed neque currentem se nec cognoscit euntem<br>tollentemue manu saxumue immane mouentem;<br>genua labant, gelidus concreuit frigore sanguis.<br>tum lapis ipse uiri uacuum per inane uolutus<br>nec spatium euasit totum neque pertulit ictum.<br>ac uelut in somnis, oculos ubi languida pressit<br>nocte quies, nequiquam auidos extendere cursus<br>uelle uidemur et in mediis conatibus aegri<br>succidimus; non lingua ualet, non corpore notae<br>sufficiunt uires nec uox aut uerba sequuntur:<br>sic Turno, quacumque uiam uirtute petiuit,<br>successum dea dira negat. tum pectore sensus<br>uertuntur uarii; Rutulos aspectat et urbem<br>cunctaturque metu letumque instare tremescit,<br>nec quo se eripiat, nec qua ui tendat in hostem,<br>nec currus usquam uidet aurigamue sororem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>As he wavers Aeneas poises the deadly weapon, and, marking his chance, hurls it in from afar with all his strength of body. Never with such a roar are stones hurled from some engine on ramparts, nor does the thunder burst in so loud a peal. Carrying grim death with it, the spear flies in fashion of some dark whirlwind, and opens the rim of the corslet and the utmost circles of the sevenfold shield. Right through the thigh it passes hurtling on; under the blow Turnus falls huge to earth with his leg doubled under him. The Rutulians start up with a groan, and all the hill echoes round about, and the width of high woodland returns their cry. Lifting up beseechingly his humbled eyes and suppliant hand: "I have deserved it," he says, "nor do I ask for mercy; use thy fortune. If an unhappy parent's distress may at all touch thee, this I pray; even such a father was Anchises to thee; pity Daunus' old age, and restore to my kindred which thou wilt, me or my body bereft of day. Thou art conqueror, and Ausonia hath seen me stretch conquered hands. Lavinia is thine in marriage; press not thy hatred farther." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Cunctanti telum Aeneas fatale coruscat,<br>sortitus fortunam oculis, et corpore toto<br>eminus intorquet. murali concita numquam<br>tormento sic saxa fremunt nec fulmine tanti<br>dissultant crepitus. uolat atri turbinis instar<br>exitium dirum hasta ferens orasque recludit<br>loricae et clipei extremos septemplicis orbis;<br>per medium stridens transit femur. incidit ictus<br>ingens ad terram duplicato poplite Turnus.<br>consurgunt gemitu Rutuli totusque remugit<br>mons circum et uocem late nemora alta remittunt.<br>ille humilis supplex oculos dextramque precantem<br>protendens 'equidem merui nec deprecor' inquit;<br>'utere sorte tua. miseri te si qua parentis<br>tangere cura potest, oro (fuit et tibi talis<br>Anchises genitor) Dauni miserere senectae<br>et me, seu corpus spoliatum lumine mauis,<br>redde meis. uicisti et uictum tendere palmas<br>Ausonii uidere; tua est Lauinia coniunx,<br>ulterius ne tende odiis.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Aeneas stood wrathful in arms, with rolling eyes, and lowered his hand; and now and now yet more the speech began to bend him to waver: when high on his shoulder appeared the sword-belt with the shining bosses that he knew, the luckless belt of the boy Pallas, whom Turnus had struck down with mastering wound, and wore on his shoulders the fatal ornament. The other, as his eyes drank in the plundered record of his fierce grief, kindles to fury, and cries terrible in anger: "Mayest thou, thou clad in the spoils of my dearest, escape mine hands? Pallas it is, Pallas who now strikes the sacrifice, and exacts vengeance in thy guilty blood." So saying, he fiercely plunges the steel full in his breast. But his limbs grow slack and chill, and the life with a moan flies indignantly into the dark. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">stetit acer in armis<br>Aeneas uoluens oculos dextramque repressit;<br>et iam iamque magis cunctantem flectere sermo<br>coeperat, infelix umero cum apparuit alto<br>balteus et notis fulserunt cingula bullis<br>Pallantis pueri, uictum quem uulnere Turnus<br>strauerat atque umeris inimicum insigne gerebat.<br>ille, oculis postquam saeui monimenta doloris<br>exuuiasque hausit, furiis accensus et ira<br>terribilis: 'tune hinc spoliis indute meorum<br>eripiare mihi?
