Why the broad blaze is lit lies unknown; but the bitter pain of a great love trampled, and the knowledge of what woman can do in madness, draw the Teucrians' hearts to gloomy guesses. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea medium Aeneas iam classe tenebat<br>certus iter fluctusque atros Aquilone secabat<br>moenia respiciens, quae iam infelicis Elissae<br>conlucent flammis. quae tantum accenderit ignem<br>causa latet; duri magno sed amore dolores<br>polluto, notumque furens quid femina possit,<br>triste per augurium Teucrorum pectora ducunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>When their ships held the deep, nor any land farther appears, the seas all round, and all round the sky, a dusky shower drew up overhead, carrying night and storm, and the wave shuddered and gloomed. Palinurus, master of the fleet, cries from the high stern: "Alas, why have these heavy storm-clouds girt the sky? lord Neptune, what wilt thou?" Then he bids clear the rigging and bend strongly to the oars, and brings the sails across the wind, saying thus: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ut pelagus tenuere rates nec iam amplius ulla<br>occurrit tellus, maria undique et undique caelum,<br>olli caeruleus supra caput astitit imber<br>noctem hiememque ferens et inhorruit unda tenebris.<br>ipse gubernator puppi Palinurus ab alta:<br>'heu quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?<br>quidue, pater Neptune, paras?' sic deinde locutus<br>colligere arma iubet ualidisque incumbere remis,<br>obliquatque sinus in uentum ac talia fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Noble Aeneas, not did Jupiter give word and warrant would I hope to reach Italy under such a sky. The shifting winds roar athwart our course, and blow stronger out of the black west, and the air thickens into mist: nor are we fit to force our way on and across. Fortune is the stronger; let us follow her, and turn our course whither she calls. Not far away, I think, are the faithful shores of thy brother Eryx, and the Sicilian haven, if only my memory retraces rightly the stars I watched before." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'magnanime Aenea, non, si mihi Iuppiter auctor<br>spondeat, hoc sperem Italiam contingere caelo.<br>mutati transuersa fremunt et uespere ab atro<br>consurgunt uenti, atque in nubem cogitur aer.<br>nec nos obniti contra nec tendere tantum<br>sufficimus. superat quoniam Fortuna, sequamur,<br>quoque uocat uertamus iter. nec litora longe<br>fida reor fraterna Erycis portusque Sicanos,<br>si modo rite memor seruata remetior astra.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then good Aeneas: "Even I ere now discern the winds will have it so, and thou urgest against them in vain. Turn thou the course of our sailing. Could any land be welcomer to me, or where I would sooner choose to put in my weary ships, than this that hath Dardanian Acestes to greet me, and laps in its embrace lord Anchises' dust?" This said, they steer for harbour, while the following west wind stretches their sails; the fleet runs fast down the flood, and at last they land joyfully on the familiar beach. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">tum pius Aeneas: "equidem sic poscere uentos<br>iamdudum et frustra cerno te tendere contra.<br>flecte uiam uelis. an sit mihi gratior ulla,<br>quoue magis fessas optem dimittere nauis,<br>quam quae Dardanium tellus mihi seruat Acesten<br>et patris Anchisae gremio complectitur ossa?"<br>haec ubi dicta, petunt portus et uela secundi<br>intendunt Zephyri; fertur cita gurgite classis,<br>et tandem laeti notae aduertuntur harenae.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But Acestes high on a hill-top, amazed at the friendly squadron approaching from afar, hastens towards them, weaponed and clad in the shaggy skin of a Libyan she-bear. Him a Trojan mother conceived and bore to Crimisus river; not forgetful of his parentage, he wishes them joy of their return, and gladly entertains them on his rustic treasure and comforts their weariness with his friendly store. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At procul ex celso miratus uertice montis aduentum sociasque rates occurrit Acestes, horridus in iaculis et pelle Libystidis ursae,<br>Troia Criniso conceptum flumine mater<br>quem genuit. ueterum non immemor ille parentum<br>gratatur reduces et gaza laetus agresti<br>excipit, ac fessos opibus solatur amicis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So soon as the morrow's clear daylight had chased the stars out of the east, Aeneas calls his comrades along the beach together, and from a mounded hillock speaks: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postera cum primo stellas Oriente fugarat<br>clara dies, socios in coetum litore ab omni<br>aduocat Aeneas tumulique ex aggere fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Great people of Dardanus, born of the high blood of gods, the yearly circle of the months is measured out to fulfilment since we laid the dust in earth, all that was left of my divine father, and sadly consecrated our altars. And now the day is at hand (this, O gods, was your will), which I will ever keep in grief, ever in honour. Did I spend it an exile on Gaetulian quicksands, did it surprise me on the Argolic sea or in Mycenae town, yet would I fulfil the yearly vows and annual ordinance of festival, and pile the altars with their due gifts. Now we are led hither, to the very dust and ashes of our father, not as I deem without divine purpose and influence, and borne home into the friendly haven. Up then and let us all gather joyfully to the sacrifice: pray we for winds, and may he deign that I pay these rites to him year by year in an established city and consecrated temple. Two head of oxen Acestes, the seed of Troy, gives to each of your ships by tale: invite to the feast your own ancestral gods of the household, and those whom our host Acestes worships. Further, so the ninth Dawn uplift the gracious day upon men, and her shafts unveil the world, I will ordain contests for my Trojans; first for swift ships; then whoso excels in the foot-race, and whoso, confident in strength and skill, comes to shoot light arrows, or adventures to join battle with gloves of raw hide; let all be here, and let merit look for the prize and palm. Now all be hushed, and twine your temples with boughs." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Dardanidae magni, genus alto a sanguine diuum,<br>annuus exactis completur mensibus orbis,<br>ex quo reliquias diuinique ossa parentis<br>condidimus terra maestasque sacrauimus aras;<br>iamque dies, nisi fallor, adest, quem semper acerbum,<br>semper honoratum (sic di uoluistis) habebo.<br>hunc ego Gaetulis agerem si Syrtibus exsul,<br>Argolicoue mari deprensus et urbe Mycenae,<br>annua uota tamen sollemnisque ordine pompas<br>exsequerer strueremque suis altaria donis.<br>nunc ultro ad cineres ipsius et ossa parentis<br>haud equidem sine mente, reor, sine numine diuum<br>adsumus et portus delati intramus amicos.<br>ergo agite et laetum cuncti celebremus honorem:<br>poscamus uentos, atque haec me sacra quotannis<br>urbe uelit posita templis sibi ferre dicatis.<br>bina boum uobis Troia generatus Acestes<br>dat numero capita in nauis; adhibete penatis<br>et patrios epulis et quos colit hospes Acestes.<br>praeterea, si nona diem mortalibus almum<br>Aurora extulerit radiisque retexerit orbem,<br>prima citae Teucris ponam certamina classis;<br>quique pedum cursu ualet, et qui uiribus audax<br>aut iaculo incedit melior leuibusque sagittis,<br>seu crudo fidit pugnam committere caestu,<br>cuncti adsint meritaeque exspectent praemia palmae.<br>ore fauete omnes et cingite tempora ramis.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So speaks he, and shrouds his brows with his mother's myrtle. So Helymus does, so Aletes ripe of years, so the boy Ascanius, and the rest of the people follow. He advances from the assembly to the tomb among a throng of many thousands that crowd about him; here he pours on the ground in fit libation two goblets of pure wine, two of new milk, two of consecrated blood, and flings bright blossoms, saying thus: "Hail, holy father, once again; hail, ashes of him I saved in vain, and soul and shade of my sire! Thou wert not to share the search for Italian borders and destined fields, nor the dim Ausonian Tiber." Thus had he spoken; when from beneath the sanctuary a snake slid out in seven vast coils and sevenfold slippery spires, quietly circling the grave and gliding from altar to altar, his green chequered body and the spotted lustre of his scales ablaze with gold, as the bow in the cloud darts a thousand changing dyes athwart the sun: Aeneas stood amazed at the sight. At last he wound his long train among the vessels and polished cups, and tasted the feast, and again leaving the altars where he had fed, crept harmlessly back beneath the tomb. Doubtful if he shall think it the Genius of the ground or his father's ministrant, he slays, as is fit, two sheep of two years old, as many swine and dark-backed steers, pouring the while cups of wine, and calling on the soul of great Anchises and the ghost rearisen from Acheron. Therewithal his comrades, as each hath store, bring gifts to heap joyfully on the altars, and slay steers in sacrifice: others set cauldrons arow, and, lying along the grass, heap live embers under spits and roast the flesh. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Sic fatus uelat materna tempora myrto.<br>hoc Helymus facit, hoc aeui maturus Acestes,<br>hoc puer Ascanius, sequitur quos cetera pubes.<br>ille e concilio multis cum milibus ibat<br>ad tumulum magna medius comitante caterua.<br>hic duo rite mero libans carchesia Baccho<br>fundit humi, duo lacte nouo, duo sanguine sacro,<br>purpureosque iacit flores ac talia fatur:<br>'salue, sancte parens, iterum; saluete, recepti<br>nequiquam cineres animaeque umbraeque paternae.<br>non licuit finis Italos fataliaque arua<br>nec tecum Ausonium, quicumque est, quaerere Thybrim.'<br>dixerat haec, adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis<br>septem ingens gyros, septena uolumina traxit<br>amplexus placide tumulum lapsusque per aras,<br>caeruleae cui terga notae maculosus et auro<br>squamam incendebat fulgor, ceu nubibus arcus<br>mille iacit uarios aduerso sole colores.<br>obstipuit uisu Aeneas. ille agmine longo<br>tandem inter pateras et leuia pocula serpens<br>libauitque dapes rursusque innoxius imo<br>successit tumulo et depasta altaria liquit.<br>hoc magis inceptos genitori instaurat honores,<br>incertus geniumne loci famulumne parentis<br>esse putet; caedit binas de more bidentis<br>totque sues, totidem nigrantis terga iuuencos,<br>uinaque fundebat pateris animamque uocabat<br>Anchisae magni manisque Acheronte remissos.<br>nec non et socii, quae cuique est copia, laeti<br>dona ferunt, onerant aras mactantque iuuencos;<br>ordine aena locant alii fusique per herbam<br>subiciunt ueribus prunas et uiscera torrent.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The desired day came, and now the ninth Dawn rode up clear and bright behind PhaÃ«thon's coursers; and the name and renown of illustrious Acestes had stirred up all the bordering people; their holiday throng filled the shore, to see Aeneas' men, and some ready to join in contest. First of all the prizes are laid out to view in the middle of the racecourse; tripods of sacrifice, green garlands and palms, the reward of the conquerors, armour and garments dipped in purple, talents of silver and gold: and from a hillock in the midst the trumpet sounds the games begun. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Exspectata dies aderat nonamque serena<br>Auroram Phaethontis equi iam luce uehebant,<br>famaque finitimos et clari nomen Acestae<br>excierat; laeto complerant litora coetu<br>uisuri Aeneadas, pars et certare parati.<br>munera principio ante oculos circoque locantur<br>in medio, sacri tripodes uiridesque coronae<br>et palmae pretium uictoribus, armaque et ostro<br>perfusae uestes, argenti aurique talenta;<br>et tuba commissos medio canit aggere ludos.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>First is the contest of rowing, and four ships matched in weight enter, the choice of all the fleet. Mnestheus' keen oarsmen drive the swift Dragon, Mnestheus the Italian to be, from whose name is the Memmian family; Gyas the huge bulk of the huge Chimaera, a floating town, whom her triple-tiered Dardanian crew urge on with oars rising in threefold rank; Sergestus, from whom the Sergian house holds her name, sails in the tall Centaur; and in the sea-coloured Scylla Cloanthus, whence is thy family, Cluentius of Rome. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Prima pares ineunt grauibus certamina remis<br>quattuor ex omni delectae classe carinae.<br>uelocem Mnestheus agit acri remige Pristim,<br>mox Italus Mnestheus, genus a quo nomine Memmi,<br>ingentemque Gyas ingenti mole Chimaeram,<br>urbis opus, triplici pubes quam Dardana uersu<br>impellunt, terno consurgunt ordine remi;<br>Sergestusque, domus tenet a quo Sergia nomen,<br>Centauro inuehitur magna, Scyllaque Cloanthus<br>caerulea, genus unde tibi, Romane Cluenti.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Apart in the sea and over against the foaming beach, lies a rock that the swoln waves beat and drown what time the north-western gales of winter blot out the stars; in calm it rises silent out of the placid water, flat-topped, and a haunt where cormorants love best to take the sun. Here lord Aeneas set up a goal of leafy ilex, a mark for the sailors to know whence to return, where to wheel their long course round. Then they choose stations by lot, and on the sterns their captains glitter afar, beautiful in gold and purple; the rest of the crews are crowned with poplar sprays, and their naked shoulders glisten wet with oil. They sit down at the thwarts, and their arms are tense on the oars; at full strain they wait the signal, while throbbing fear and heightened ambition drain their riotous blood. Then, when the clear trumpet-note rang, all in a moment leap forward from their line; the shouts of the sailors strike up to heaven, and the channels are swept into foam by the arms as they swing backward. They cleave their furrows together, and all the sea is torn asunder by oars and triple-pointed prows. Not with speed so headlong do racing pairs whirl the chariots over the plain, as they rush streaming from the barriers; not so do their charioteers shake the wavy reins loose over their team, and hang forward on the whip. All the woodland rings with clapping and shouts of men that cheer their favourites, and the sheltered beach eddies back their cries; the noise buffets and re-echoes from the hills. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Est procul in pelago saxum spumantia contra<br>litora, quod tumidis summersum tunditur olim<br>fluctibus, hiberni condunt ubi sidera Cauri;<br>tranquillo silet immotaque attollitur unda<br>campus et apricis statio gratissima mergis.<br>hic uiridem Aeneas frondenti ex ilice metam<br>constituit signum nautis pater, unde reuerti<br>scirent et longos ubi circumflectere cursus.<br>tum loca sorte legunt ipsique in puppibus auro<br>ductores longe effulgent ostroque decori;<br>cetera populea uelatur fronde iuuentus<br>nudatosque umeros oleo perfusa nitescit.<br>considunt transtris, intentaque bracchia remis;<br>intenti exspectant signum, exsultantiaque haurit<br>corda pauor pulsans laudumque arrecta cupido.<br>inde ubi clara dedit sonitum tuba, finibus omnes,<br>haud mora, prosiluere suis; ferit aethera clamor<br>nauticus, adductis spumant freta uersa lacertis.<br>infindunt pariter sulcos, totumque dehiscit<br>conuulsum remis rostrisque tridentibus aequor.<br>non tam praecipites biiugo certamine campum<br>corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus,<br>nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora<br>concussere iugis pronique in uerbera pendent.<br>tum plausu fremituque uirum studiisque fauentum<br>consonat omne nemus, uocemque inclusa uolutant<br>litora, pulsati colles clamore resultant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Gyas shoots out in front of the noisy crowd, and glides foremost along the water; whom Cloanthus follows next, rowing better, but held back by his dragging weight of pine. After them, at equal distance, the Dragon and the Centaur strive to win the foremost room; and now the Dragon has it, now the vast Centaur outstrips and passes her; now they dart on both together, their stems in a line, and their keels driving long furrows through the salt water-ways. And now they drew nigh the rock, and were hard on the goal; when Gyas as he led, winner over half the flood, cries aloud to Menoetes, the ship's steersman: "Whither away so far to the right? This way direct her path; kiss the shore, and let the oarblade graze the leftward reefs. Others may keep to deep water." He spoke; but Menoetes, fearing blind rocks, turns the bow away towards the open sea. "Whither wanderest thou away? to the rocks, Menoetes!" again shouts Gyas to bring him back; and lo! glancing round he sees Cloanthus passing up behind and keeping nearer. Between Gyas' ship and the echoing crags he scrapes through inside on his left, flashes past his leader, and leaving the goal behind is in safe water. Then indeed grief burned fierce through his strong frame, and tears sprung out on his cheeks; heedless of his own dignity and his crew's safety, he flings the too cautious Menoetes sheer into the sea from the high stern, himself succeeds as guide and master of the helm, and cheers on his men, and turns his tiller in to shore. But Menoetes, when at last he rose struggling from the bottom, heavy with advancing years and wet in his dripping clothes, makes for the top of the crag, and sits down on a dry rock. The Teucrians laughed out as he fell and as he swam, and laugh to see him spitting the salt water from his chest. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Effugit ante alios primisque elabitur undis<br>turbam inter fremitumque Gyas; quem deinde Cloanthus<br>consequitur, melior remis, sed pondere pinus<br>tarda tenet. post hos aequo discrimine Pristis<br>Centaurusque locum tendunt superare priorem;<br>et nunc Pristis habet, nunc uictam praeterit ingens<br>Centaurus, nunc una ambae iunctisque feruntur<br>frontibus et longa sulcant uada salsa carina.<br>iamque propinquabant scopulo metamque tenebant,<br>cum princeps medioque Gyas in gurgite uictor<br>rectorem nauis compellat uoce Menoeten:<br>'quo tantum mihi dexter abis? huc derige cursum;<br>litus ama et laeua stringat sine palmula cautes;<br>altum alii teneant.' dixit; sed caeca Menoetes<br>saxa timens proram pelagi detorquet ad undas.<br>'quo diuersus abis?' iterum 'pete saxa, Menoete!'<br>cum clamore Gyas reuocabat, et ecce Cloanthum<br>respicit instantem tergo et propiora tenentem.<br>ille inter nauemque Gyae scopulosque sonantis<br>radit iter laeuum interior subitoque priorem<br>praeterit et metis tenet aequora tuta relictis.<br>tum uero exarsit iuueni dolor ossibus ingens<br>nec lacrimis caruere genae, segnemque Menoeten<br>oblitus decorisque sui sociumque salutis<br>in mare praecipitem puppi deturbat ab alta;<br>ipse gubernaclo rector subit, ipse magister<br>hortaturque uiros clauumque ad litora torquet.<br>at grauis ut fundo uix tandem redditus imo est<br>iam senior madidaque fluens in ueste Menoetes<br>summa petit scopuli siccaque in rupe resedit.<br>illum et labentem Teucri et risere natantem<br>et salsos rident reuomentem pectore fluctus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>At this a joyful hope kindled in the two behind, Sergestus and Mnestheus, of catching up Gyas' wavering course. Sergestus slips forward as he nears the rock, yet not all in front, nor leading with his length of keel; part is in front, part pressed by the Dragon's jealous prow. But striding amidships between his comrades, Mnestheus cheers them on: "Now, now swing back, oarsmen who were Hector's comrades, whom I chose to follow me in Troy's extremity; now put forth the might and courage you showed in Gaetulian quicksands, amid Ionian seas and Malea's chasing waves. Not the first place do I now seek for Mnestheus, nor strive for victory; though ah!â€”yet let them win, O Neptune, to whom thou givest it. But the shame of coming in last! Win but this, fellow-citizens, and avert that disaster!" His men bend forward, straining every muscle; the brasswork of the ship quivers to their mighty strokes, and the ground runs from under her; limbs and parched lips shake with their rapid panting, and sweat flows in streams all over them. Mere chance brought the crew the glory they desired. For while Sergestus drives his prow furiously in towards the rocks and comes up with too scanty room, alas! he caught on a rock that ran out; the reef ground, the oars struck and shivered on the jagged teeth, and the bows crashed and hung. The sailors leap up and hold her with loud cries, and get out iron-shod poles and sharp-pointed boathooks, and pick up their broken oars out of the eddies. But Mnestheus, rejoicing and flushed by his triumph, with oars fast-dipping and winds at his call, issues into the shelving water and runs down the open sea. As a pigeon whose house and sweet nestlings are in the rock's recesses, if suddenly startled from her cavern, wings her flight over the fields and rushes frightened from her house with loud clapping pinions; then gliding noiselessly through the air, slides on her liquid way and moves not her rapid wings; so Mnestheus, so the Dragon under him swiftly cleaves the last space of sea, so her own speed carries her flying on. And first Sergestus is left behind, struggling on the steep rock and shoal water, and shouting in vain for help and learning to race with broken oars. Next he catches up Gyas and the vast bulk of the Chimaera; she gives way, without her steersman. And now on the very goal Cloanthus alone is left; him he pursues and presses hard, straining all his strength. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic laeta extremis spes est accensa duobus,<br>Sergesto Mnestheique, Gyan superare morantem.<br>Sergestus capit ante locum scopuloque propinquat,<br>nec tota tamen ille prior praeeunte carina;<br>parte prior, partim rostro premit aemula Pristis.<br>at media socios incedens naue per ipsos<br>hortatur Mnestheus: 'nunc, nunc insurgite remis,<br>Hectorei socii, Troiae quos sorte suprema<br>delegi comites; nunc illas promite uiris,<br>nunc animos, quibus in Gaetulis Syrtibus usi<br>Ionioque mari Maleaeque sequacibus undis.<br>non iam prima peto Mnestheus neque uincere certo<br>(quamquam o!â€”sed superent quibus hoc, Neptune, dedisti);<br>extremos pudeat rediisse: hoc uincite, ciues,<br>et prohibete nefas.' olli certamine summo<br>procumbunt: uastis tremit ictibus aerea puppis<br>subtrahiturque solum, tum creber anhelitus artus<br>aridaque ora quatit, sudor fluit undique riuis.<br>attulit ipse uiris optatum casus honorem:<br>namque furens animi dum proram ad saxa suburget<br>interior spatioque subit Sergestus iniquo,<br>infelix saxis in procurrentibus haesit.<br>concussae cautes et acuto in murice remi<br>obnixi crepuere inlisaque prora pependit.<br>consurgunt nautae et magno clamore morantur<br>ferratasque trudes et acuta cuspide contos<br>expediunt fractosque legunt in gurgite remos.<br>at laetus Mnestheus successuque acrior ipso<br>agmine remorum celeri uentisque uocatis<br>prona petit maria et pelago decurrit aperto.<br>qualis spelunca subito commota columba,<br>cui domus et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi,<br>fertur in arua uolans plausumque exterrita pennis<br>dat tecto ingentem, mox aere lapsa quieto<br>radit iter liquidum celeris neque commouet alas:<br>sic Mnestheus, sic ipsa fuga secat ultima Pristis<br>aequora, sic illam fert impetus ipse uolantem.<br>et primum in scopulo luctantem deserit alto<br>Sergestum breuibusque uadis frustraque uocantem<br>auxilia et fractis discentem currere remis.<br>inde Gyan ipsamque ingenti mole Chimaeram<br>consequitur; cedit, quoniam spoliata magistro est.<br>solus iamque ipso superest in fine Cloanthus,<br>quem petit et summis adnixus uiribus urget.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then indeed the shouts redouble, as all together eagerly cheer on the pursuer, and the sky echoes their din. These scorn to lose the honour that is their own, the glory in their grasp, and would sell life for renown; to these success lends life; power comes with belief in it. And haply they had carried the prize with prows abreast, had not Cloanthus, stretching both his open hands over the sea, poured forth prayers and called the gods to hear his vows: "Gods who are sovereign on the sea, over whose waters I run, to your altars on this beach will I bring a snow-white bull, my vow's glad penalty, and will cast his entrails into the salt flood and pour liquid wine." He spoke, and far beneath the flood maiden Panopea heard him, with all Phorcus' choir of Nereids, and lord Portunus with his own mighty hand pushed him on his way. The ship flies to land swifter than the wind or an arrow's flight, and shoots into the deep harbour. Then the seed of Anchises, summoning all in order, declares Cloanthus conqueror by herald's outcry, and dresses his brows in green bay, and gives gifts to each crew, three bullocks of their choice, and wine, and a large talent of silver to take away. For their captains he adds special honours; to the winner a scarf wrought with gold, encircled by a double border of deep Meliboean purple; woven in it is the kingly boy on leafy Ida, chasing swift stags with javelin and racing feet, keen and as one panting; him Jove's swooping armour-bearer hath caught up from Ida in his talons; his aged guardians stretch their hands vainly upwards, and the barking of hounds rings fierce into the air. But to him who, next in merit, held the second place, he gives to wear a corslet triple-woven with hooks of polished gold, stripped by his own conquering hand from Demoleos under tall Troy by the swift SimoÃ¯s, an ornament and safeguard among arms. Scarce could the straining shoulders of his servants Phegeus and Sagaris carry its heavy folds; yet with it on, Demoleos at full speed would chase the scattered Trojans. The third prize he makes twin cauldrons of brass, and bowls wrought in silver and rough with tracery. And now all moved away in the pride and wealth of their prizes, their brows bound with scarlet ribbons; when, hardly torn loose by all his art from the cruel rock, his oars lost, rowing feebly with a single tier, Sergestus brought in his ship jeered at and unhonoured. Even as often a serpent caught on a highway, if a brazen wheel hath gone aslant over him or a wayfarer left him half dead and mangled with the blow of a heavy stone, wreathes himself slowly in vain effort to escape, in part undaunted, his eyes ablaze and his hissing throat lifted high; in part the disabling wound keeps him coiling in knots and twisting back on his own body; so the ship kept rowing slowly on, yet hoists sail and under full sail glides into the harbour mouth. Glad that the ship is saved and the crew brought back, Aeneas presents Sergestus with his promised reward. A slave woman is given him not unskilled in Minerva's labours, PholoÃ« the Cretan, with twin boys at her breast. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum uero ingeminat clamor cunctique sequentem<br>instigant studiis, resonatque fragoribus aether.<br>hi proprium decus et partum indignantur honorem<br>ni teneant, uitamque uolunt pro laude pacisci;<br>hos successus alit: possunt, quia posse uidentur.<br>et fors aequatis cepissent praemia rostris,<br>ni palmas ponto tendens utrasque Cloanthus<br>fudissetque preces diuosque in uota uocasset:<br>'di, quibus imperium est pelagi, quorum aequora curro,<br>uobis laetus ego hoc candentem in litore taurum<br>constituam ante aras uoti reus, extaque salsos<br>proiciam in fluctus et uina liquentia fundam.'<br>dixit, eumque imis sub fluctibus audiit omnis<br>Nereidum Phorcique chorus Panopeaque uirgo,<br>et pater ipse manu magna Portunus euntem<br>impulit: illa Noto citius uolucrique sagitta<br>ad terram fugit et portu se condidit alto.<br>tum satus Anchisa cunctis ex more uocatis<br>uictorem magna praeconis uoce Cloanthum<br>declarat uiridique aduelat tempora lauro,<br>muneraque in nauis ternos optare iuuencos<br>uinaque et argenti magnum dat ferre talentum.<br>ipsis praecipuos ductoribus addit honores:<br>uictori chlamydem auratam, quam plurima circum<br>purpura maeandro duplici Meliboea cucurrit,<br>intextusque puer frondosa regius Ida<br>uelocis iaculo ceruos cursuque fatigat<br>acer, anhelanti similis, quem praepes ab Ida<br>sublimem pedibus rapuit Iouis armiger uncis;<br>longaeui palmas nequiquam ad sidera tendunt<br>custodes, saeuitque canum latratus in auras.<br>at qui deinde locum tenuit uirtute secundum,<br>leuibus huic hamis consertam auroque trilicem<br>loricam, quam Demoleo detraxerat ipse<br>uictor apud rapidum Simoenta sub Ilio alto,<br>donat habere, uiro decus et tutamen in armis.<br>uix illam famuli Phegeus Sagarisque ferebant<br>multiplicem conixi umeris; indutus at olim<br>Demoleos cursu palantis Troas agebat.<br>tertia dona facit geminos ex aere lebetas<br>cymbiaque argento perfecta atque aspera signis.<br>iamque adeo donati omnes opibusque superbi<br>puniceis ibant euincti tempora taenis,<br>cum saeuo e scopulo multa uix arte reuulsus<br>amissis remis atque ordine debilis uno<br>inrisam sine honore ratem Sergestus agebat.<br>qualis saepe uiae deprensus in aggere serpens,<br>aerea quem obliquum rota transiit aut grauis ictu<br>seminecem liquit saxo lacerumque uiator;<br>nequiquam longos fugiens dat corpore tortus<br>parte ferox ardensque oculis et sibila colla<br>arduus attollens; pars uulnere clauda retentat<br>nexantem nodis seque in sua membra plicantem:<br>tali remigio nauis se tarda mouebat;<br>uela facit tamen et uelis subit ostia plenis.<br>Sergestum Aeneas promisso munere donat<br>seruatam ob nauem laetus sociosque reductos.<br>olli serua datur operum haud ignara Mineruae,<br>Cressa genus, Pholoe, geminique sub ubere nati.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This contest sped, good Aeneas moved to a grassy plain girt all about with winding wooded hills, and amid the valley an amphitheatre, whither, with a concourse of many thousands, the hero advanced and took his seat on a mound. Here he allures with rewards and offer of prizes those who will try their hap in the fleet foot-race. Trojans and Sicilians gather mingling from all sides, Nisus and Euryalus foremost â€¦ Euryalus in the flower of youth and famed for beauty, Nisus for pure love of the boy. Next follows renowned Diores, of Priam's royal line; after him Salius and Patron together, the one Acarnanian, the other Tegean by family and of Arcadian blood; next two men of Sicily, Helymus and Panopes, foresters and attendants on old Acestes; many besides whose fame is hid in obscurity. Then among them all Aeneas spoke thus: "Hearken to this, and attend in good cheer. None out of this number will I let go without a gift. To each will I give two glittering Gnosian spearheads of polished steel, and an axe chased with silver to bear away; one and all shall be honoured thus. The three foremost shall receive prizes, and have pale olive bound about their head. The first shall have a caparisoned horse as conqueror; the second an Amazonian quiver filled with arrows of Thrace, girt about by a broad belt of gold, and on the link of the clasp a polished gem; let the third depart with this Argolic helmet for recompense." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hoc pius Aeneas misso certamine tendit<br>gramineum in campum, quem collibus undique curuis<br>cingebant siluae, mediaque in ualle theatri<br>circus erat; quo se multis cum milibus heros<br>consessu medium tulit exstructoque resedit.<br>hic, qui forte uelint rapido contendere cursu,<br>inuitat pretiis animos, et praemia ponit.<br>undique conueniunt Teucri mixtique Sicani,<br>Nisus et Euryalus primi,<br>Euryalus forma insignis uiridique iuuenta,<br>Nisus amore pio pueri; quos deinde secutus<br>regius egregia Priami de stirpe Diores;<br>hunc Salius simul et Patron, quorum alter Acarnan,<br>alter ab Arcadio Tegeaeae sanguine gentis;<br>tum duo Trinacrii iuuenes, Helymus Panopesque<br>adsueti siluis, comites senioris Acestae;<br>multi praeterea, quos fama obscura recondit.<br>Aeneas quibus in mediis sic deinde locutus:<br>'accipite haec animis laetasque aduertite mentes.<br>nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit.<br>Cnosia bina dabo leuato lucida ferro<br>spicula caelatamque argento ferre bipennem;<br>omnibus hic erit unus honos. tres praemia primi<br>accipient flauaque caput nectentur oliua.<br>primus equum phaleris insignem uictor habeto;<br>alter Amazoniam pharetram plenamque sagittis<br>Threiciis, lato quam circum amplectitur auro<br>balteus et tereti subnectit fibula gemma;<br>tertius Argolica hac galea contentus abito.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This said, they take their place, and the signal once heard, dart over the course and leave the line, pouring forth like a storm-cloud while they mark the goal. Nisus gets away first, and shoots out far in front of the throng, fleeter than the winds or the winged thunderbolt. Next to him, but next by a long gap, Salius follows; then, left a space behind him, Euryalus third â€¦ and Helymus comes after Euryalus; and close behind him, lo! Diores goes flying, just grazing foot with foot, hard on his shoulder; and if a longer space were left, he would creep out past him and win the tie. And now almost in the last space, they began to come up breathless to the goal, when unfortunate Nisus trips on the slippery blood of the slain steers, where haply it had spilled over the ground and wetted the green grass. Here, just in the flush of victory, he lost his feet; they slid away on the ground they pressed, and he fell forward right among the ordure and blood of the sacrifice. Yet forgot he not his darling Euryalus; for rising, he flung himself over the slippery ground in front of Salius, and he rolled over and lay all along on the hard sand. Euryalus shoots by, wins and holds the first place his friend gave, and flies on amid prosperous clapping and cheers. Behind Helymus comes up, and Diores, now third for the palm. At this Salius fills with loud clamour the whole concourse of the vast theatre, and the lords who looked on in front, demanding restoration of his defrauded prize. Euryalus is strong in favour, and beauty in tears, and the merit that gains grace from so fair a form. Diores supports him, who succeeded to the palm, so he loudly cries, and bore off the last prize in vain, if the highest honours be restored to Salius. Then lord Aeneas speaks: "For you, O boys, your rewards remain assured, and none alters the prizes" order: let me be allowed to pity a friend's innocent mischance.' So speaking, he gives to Salius a vast Gaetulian lion-skin, with shaggy masses of hair and claws of gold. "If this," cries Nisus, "is the reward of defeat, and thy pity is stirred for the fallen, what fit recompense wilt thou give to Nisus? to my excellence the first crown was due, had not I, like Salius, met Fortune's hostility." And with the words he displayed his face and limbs foul with the wet dung. His lord laughed kindly on him, and bade a shield be brought forth, the workmanship of Didymaon, torn by him from the hallowed gates of Neptune's Grecian temple; with this special prize he rewards his excellence. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta, locum capiunt signoque repente<br>corripiunt spatia audito limenque relinquunt,<br>effusi nimbo similes. simul ultima signant,<br>primus abit longeque ante omnia corpora Nisus<br>emicat et uentis et fulminis ocior alis;<br>proximus huic, longo sed proximus interuallo,<br>insequitur Salius; spatio post deinde relicto<br>tertius Euryalus;<br>Euryalumque Helymus sequitur; quo deinde sub ipso<br>ecce uolat calcemque terit iam calce Diores<br>incumbens umero, spatia et si plura supersint<br>transeat elapsus prior ambiguumque relinquat.<br>iamque fere spatio extremo fessique sub ipsam<br>finem aduentabant, leui cum sanguine Nisus<br>labitur infelix, caesis ut forte iuuencis<br>fusus humum uiridisque super madefecerat herbas.<br>hic iuuenis iam uictor ouans uestigia presso<br>haud tenuit titubata solo, sed pronus in ipso<br>concidit immundoque fimo sacroque cruore.<br>non tamen Euryali, non ille oblitus amorum:<br>nam sese opposuit Salio per lubrica surgens;<br>ille autem spissa iacuit reuolutus harena,<br>emicat Euryalus et munere uictor amici<br>prima tenet, plausuque uolat fremituque secundo.<br>post Helymus subit et nunc tertia palma Diores.<br>hic totum caueae consessum ingentis et ora<br>prima patrum magnis Salius clamoribus implet,<br>ereptumque dolo reddi sibi poscit honorem.<br>tutatur fauor Euryalum lacrimaeque decorae,<br>gratior et pulchro ueniens in corpore uirtus.<br>adiuuat et magna proclamat uoce Diores,<br>qui subiit palmae frustraque ad praemia uenit<br>ultima, si primi Salio reddentur honores.<br>tum pater Aeneas 'uestra' inquit 'munera uobis<br>certa manent, pueri et palmam mouet ordine nemo;<br>me liceat casus miserari insontis amici.'<br>sic fatus tergum Gaetuli immane leonis<br>dat Salio uillis onerosum atque unguibus aureis.<br>hic Nisus 'si tanta' inquit 'sunt praemia uictis,<br>et te lapsorum miseret, quae munera Niso<br>digna dabis, primam merui qui laude coronam<br>ni me, quae Salium, fortuna inimica tulisset?'<br>et simul his dictis faciem ostentabat et udo<br>turpia membra fimo. risit pater optimus olli<br>et clipeum efferri iussit, Didymaonis artes,<br>Neptuni sacro Danais de poste refixum.<br>hoc iuuenem egregium praestanti munere donat.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thereafter, when the races are finished and the gifts fulfilled: "Now," he cries, "come, whoso hath in him valour and ready heart, and lift up his arms with gauntleted hands." So speaks he, and sets forth a double prize of battle; for the conqueror a bullock gilt and garlanded; a sword and beautiful helmet to console the conquered. Straightway without pause Dares issues to view in his vast strength, rising amid loud murmurs of the people; he who alone was wont to meet Paris in combat; he who, at the mound where princely Hector lies, struck down as he came the vast bulk upborne by conquering Butes, of Amycus' Bebrycian line, and stretched him in death on the yellow sand. Such was Dares; at once he raises his head high for battle, displays his broad shoulders, and stretches and swings his arms right and left, lashing the air with blows. For him another is required; but none out of all the train durst approach or put the gloves on his hands. So he takes his stand exultant before Aeneas' feet, deeming he excelled all in victories; and thereon without more delay grasps the bull's horn with his left hand, and speaks thus: "Goddess-born, if no man dare trust himself to battle, to what conclusion shall I stand? how long is it seemly to keep me? bid me carry off thy gifts." Therewith all the Dardanians murmured assent, and bade yield him the promised prize. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Post, ubi confecti cursus et dona peregit,<br>'nunc, si cui uirtus animusque in pectore praesens,<br>adsit et euinctis attollat bracchia palmis':<br>sic ait, et geminum pugnae proponit honorem,<br>uictori uelatum auro uittisque iuuencum,<br>ensem atque insignem galeam solacia uicto.<br>nec mora; continuo uastis cum uiribus effert<br>ora Dares magnoque uirum se murmure tollit,<br>solus qui Paridem solitus contendere contra,<br>idemque ad tumulum quo maximus occubat Hector<br>uictorem Buten immani corpore, qui se<br>Bebrycia ueniens Amyci de gente ferebat,<br>perculit et fulua moribundum extendit harena.<br>talis prima Dares caput altum in proelia tollit,<br>ostenditque umeros latos alternaque iactat<br>bracchia protendens et uerberat ictibus auras.<br>quaeritur huic alius; nec quisquam ex agmine tanto<br>audet adire uirum manibusque inducere caestus.<br>ergo alacris cunctosque putans excedere palma<br>Aeneae stetit ante pedes, nec plura moratus<br>tum laeua taurum cornu tenet atque ita fatur:<br>'nate dea, si nemo audet se credere pugnae,<br>quae finis standi? quo me decet usque teneri?<br>ducere dona iube.' cuncti simul ore fremebant<br>Dardanidae reddique uiro promissa iubebant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>At this aged Acestes spoke sharply to Entellus, as he sate next him on the green cushion of grass: "Entellus, bravest of heroes once of old in vain, wilt thou thus idly let a gift so great be borne away uncontested? Where now prithee is divine Eryx, thy master of fruitless fame? where thy renown over all Sicily, and those spoils hanging in thine house?" Thereat he: "Desire of glory is not gone, nor ambition checked by fear; but torpid age dulls my chilly blood, and my strength of limb is numb and outworn. If I had what once was mine, if I had now that prime of years, yonder braggart's boast and confidence, it had taken no prize of goodly bullock to allure me; nor heed I these gifts." So he spoke, and on that flung down a pair of gloves of giant weight, with whose hard hide bound about his wrists valiant Eryx was wont to come to battle. They stood amazed; so stiff and grim lay the vast sevenfold oxhide sewed in with lead and iron. Dares most of all shrinks far back in horror, and the noble son of Anchises turns round this way and that their vast weight and voluminous folds. Then the old man spoke thus in deep accents: "How, had they seen the gloves that were Hercules' own armour, and the fatal fight on this very beach? These arms thy brother Eryx once wore; thou seest them yet stained with blood and spattered brains. In them he stood to face great Alcides; to them was I used while fuller blood supplied me strength, and envious old age had not yet strewn her snows on either temple. But if Dares of Troy will have none of these our arms, and good Aeneas is resolved on it, and my patron Acestes approves, let us make the battle even. See, I give up the gauntlets of Eryx; dismiss thy fears; and do thou put off thy Trojan gloves." So spoke he, and throwing back the fold of his raiment from his shoulders, he bares the massive joints and limbs, the great bones and muscles, and stands up huge in the middle of the ground. Then Anchises' lordly seed brought out equal gloves and bound the hands of both in matched arms. Straightway each took his stand on tiptoe, and undauntedly raised his arms high in air. They lift their heads right back and away out of reach of blows, and make hand play through hand, inviting attack; the one nimbler of foot and confident in his youth, the other mighty in mass of limb, but his knees totter tremulous and slow, and sick panting shakes his vast frame. Many a mutual blow they deliver in vain, many an one they redouble on chest and side, sounding hollow and loud: hands play fast about ear and temple, and jawbones clash under the hard strokes. Old Entellus stands immoveable and astrain, only parrying hits with body and watchful eye. The other, as one who casts mounts against some high city or blockades a hill-fort in arms, tries this and that entrance, and ranges cunningly over all the ground, and presses many an attack in vain. Entellus rose and struck clean out with his right downwards; his quick opponent saw the descending blow before it came, and slid his body rapidly out of its way. Entellus hurled his strength into the air, and all his heavy mass, overreaching, fell heavily to the earth; as sometime on Erymanthus or mighty Ida a hollow pine falls torn out by the roots. Teucrians and men of Sicily rise eagerly; a cry goes up, and Acestes himself runs forward, and pityingly lifts his friend and birthmate from the ground. But the hero, not dulled nor dismayed by his mishap, returns the keener to battle, and grows violent in wrath, while shame and resolved valour kindle his strength. All afire, he hunts Dares headlong over the lists, and redoubles his blows now with right hand, now with left; no breath nor pause; heavy as hailstones rattle on the roof from a storm-cloud, so thickly shower the blows from both his hands as he buffets Dares to and fro. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic grauis Entellum dictis castigat Acestes,<br>proximus ut uiridante toro consederat herbae:<br>'Entelle, heroum quondam fortissime frustra,<br>tantane tam patiens nullo certamine tolli<br>dona sines? ubi nunc nobis deus ille, magister<br>nequiquam memoratus, Eryx? ubi fama per omnem<br>Trinacriam et spolia illa tuis pendentia tectis?'<br>ille sub haec: 'non laudis amor nec gloria cessit<br>pulsa metu; sed enim gelidus tardante senecta<br>sanguis hebet, frigentque effetae in corpore uires.<br>si mihi quae quondam fuerat quaque improbus iste<br>exsultat fidens, si nunc foret illa iuuentas,<br>haud equidem pretio inductus pulchroque iuuenco<br>uenissem, nec dona moror.' sic deinde locutus<br>in medium geminos immani pondere caestus<br>proiecit, quibus acer Eryx in proelia suetus<br>ferre manum duroque intendere bracchia tergo.<br>obstipuere animi: tantorum ingentia septem<br>terga boum plumbo insuto ferroque rigebant.<br>ante omnis stupet ipse Dares longeque recusat,<br>magnanimusque Anchisiades et pondus et ipsa<br>huc illuc uinclorum immensa uolumina uersat.<br>tum senior talis referebat pectore uoces:<br>'quid, si quis caestus ipsius et Herculis arma<br>uidisset tristemque hoc ipso in litore pugnam?<br>haec germanus Eryx quondam tuus arma gerebat<br>(sanguine cernis adhuc sparsoque infecta cerebro),<br>his magnum Alciden contra stetit, his ego suetus,<br>dum melior uiris sanguis dabat, aemula necdum<br>temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus.<br>sed si nostra Dares haec Troius arma recusat<br>idque pio sedet Aeneae, probat auctor Acestes,<br>aequemus pugnas.

Knowest thou not the strength is another's and the gods are changed? Yield thou to Heaven." And with the words he proclaimed the battle over. But him his faithful mates lead to the ships dragging his knees feebly, swaying his head from side to side, and spitting from his mouth clotted blood mingled with teeth. At summons they bear away the helmet and shield, and leave palm and bull to Entellus. At this the conqueror, swelling in pride over the bull, cries: "Goddess-born, and you, O Trojans! learn thus what my strength of body was in its prime, and from what a death Dares is saved by your recall." He spoke, and stood right opposite in face of the bullock as it stood by, the prize of battle; then drew back his hand, and swinging the hard gauntlet sheer down between the horns, smashed the bones in upon the shattered brain. The ox rolls over, and quivering and lifeless lies along the ground. Above it he utters these deep accents: "This life, Eryx, I give to thee, a better payment than Dares' death; here I lay down my gloves and unconquered skill." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum pater Aeneas procedere longius iras<br>et saeuire animis Entellum haud passus acerbis,<br>sed finem imposuit pugnae fessumque Dareta<br>eripuit mulcens dictis ac talia fatur:<br>'infelix, quae tanta animum dementia cepit?<br>non uiris alias conuersaque numina sentis?<br>cede deo.' dixitque et proelia uoce diremit.<br>ast illum fidi aequales genua aegra trahentem<br>iactantemque utroque caput crassumque cruorem<br>ore eiectantem mixtosque in sanguine dentes<br>ducunt ad nauis; galeamque ensemque uocati<br>accipiunt, palmam Entello taurumque relinquunt.<br>hic uictor superans animis tauroque superbus<br>'nate dea, uosque haec' inquit 'cognoscite, Teucri,<br>et mihi quae fuerint iuuenali in corpore uires<br>et qua seruetis reuocatum a morte Dareta.'<br>dixit, et aduersi contra stetit ora iuuenci<br>qui donum astabat pugnae, durosque reducta<br>librauit dextra media inter cornua caestus<br>arduus, effractoque inlisit in ossa cerebro:<br>sternitur exanimisque tremens procumbit humi bos.<br>ille super talis effundit pectore uoces:<br>'hanc tibi, Eryx, meliorem animam pro morte Daretis<br>persoluo; hic uictor caestus artemque repono.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Forthwith Aeneas invites all that will to the contest of the swift arrow, and proclaims the prizes. With his strong hand he uprears the mast of Serestus' ship, and on a cord crossing it hangs from the masthead a fluttering pigeon as mark for their steel. They gather, and a helmet of brass takes the lots as they throw them in. First in rank, and before them all, amid prosperous cheers, comes out HippocoÃ¶n son of Hyrtacus; and Mnestheus follows on him, but now conqueror in the ship race, Mnestheus with his chaplet of green olive. Third is Eurytion, thy brother, O Pandarus, great in renown, thou who of old, when prompted to shatter the truce, didst hurl the first shaft amid the Achaeans. Last of all, and at the bottom of the helmet, sank Acestes, he too venturing to set hand to the task of youth. Then each and all they strongly bend their bows into a curve and pull shafts from their quivers. And first the arrow of the son of Hyrtacus, flying through heaven from the sounding string, whistles through the fleet breezes, and reaches and sticks fast full in the mast's wood: the mast quivered, and the bird fluttered her feathers in affright, and the whole ground rang with loud clapping. Next valiant Mnestheus took his stand with bow bent, aiming high with levelled eye and arrow; yet could not, unfortunate! hit the bird herself with his steel, but cut the knotted hempen bands that tied her foot as she hung from the masthead; she winged her flight into the dark windy clouds. Then Eurytion, who ere now held the arrow ready on his bended bow, swiftly called in prayer to his brother, marked the pigeon as she now went down the empty sky exultant on clapping wings; and as she passed under a dark cloud, struck her: she fell breathless, and, leaving her life in the aery firmament, slid down carrying the arrow that pierced her. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Protinus Aeneas celeri certare sagitta<br>inuitat qui forte uelint et praemia dicit,<br>ingentique manu malum de naue Seresti<br>erigit et uolucrem traiecto in fune columbam,<br>quo tendant ferrum, malo suspendit ab alto.<br>conuenere uiri deiectamque aerea sortem<br>accepit galea, et primus clamore secundo<br>Hyrtacidae ante omnis exit locus Hippocoontis;<br>quem modo nauali Mnestheus certamine uictor<br>consequitur, uiridi Mnestheus euinctus oliua.<br>tertius Eurytion, tuus, o clarissime, frater,<br>Pandare, qui quondam iussus confundere foedus<br>in medios telum torsisti primus Achiuos.<br>extremus galeaque ima subsedit Acestes,<br>ausus et ipse manu iuuenum temptare laborem.<br>tum ualidis flexos incuruant uiribus arcus<br>pro se quisque uiri et depromunt tela pharetris,<br>primaque per caelum neruo stridente sagitta<br>Hyrtacidae iuuenis uolucris diuerberat auras,<br>et uenit aduersique infigitur arbore mali.<br>intremuit malus micuitque exterrita pennis<br>ales, et ingenti sonuerunt omnia plausu.<br>post acer Mnestheus adducto constitit arcu<br>alta petens, pariterque oculos telumque tetendit.<br>ast ipsam miserandus auem contingere ferro<br>non ualuit; nodos et uincula linea rupit<br>quis innexa pedem malo pendebat ab alto;<br>illa Notos atque atra uolans in nubila fugit.<br>tum rapidus, iamdudum arcu contenta parato<br>tela tenens, fratrem Eurytion in uota uocauit,<br>iam uacuo laetam caelo speculatus et alis<br>plaudentem nigra figit sub nube columbam.<br>decidit exanimis uitamque reliquit in astris<br>aetheriis fixamque refert delapsa sagittam.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Acestes alone was over, and the prize lost; yet he sped his arrow up into the air, to display his lordly skill and resounding bow. At this a sudden sign meets their eyes, mighty in augural presage, as the high event taught thereafter, and in late days boding seers prophesied of the omen. For the flying reed blazed out amid the swimming clouds, traced its path in flame, and burned away on the light winds; even as often stars shooting from their sphere draw a train athwart the sky. Trinacrians and Trojans hung in astonishment, praying to the heavenly powers; neither did great Aeneas reject the omen, but embraces glad Acestes and loads him with lavish gifts, speaking thus: "Take, my lord: for the high King of heaven by these signs hath willed thee to draw the lot of peculiar honour. This gift shalt thou have as from aged Anchises' own hand, a bowl embossed with figures, that once Cisseus of Thrace gave my father Anchises to bear, in high token and guerdon of affection." So speaking, he twines green bay about his brows, and proclaims Acestes conqueror first before them all. Nor did gentle Eurytion, though he alone struck the bird down from the lofty sky, grudge him to be preferred in honour. Next comes for his prize he who cut the cord; he last, who pierced the mast with his winged reed. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Amissa solus palma superabat Acestes,<br>qui tamen aerias telum contendit in auras<br>ostentans artemque pater arcumque sonantem.<br>hic oculis subitum obicitur magnoque futurum<br>augurio monstrum; docuit post exitus ingens<br>seraque terrifici cecinerunt omina uates.<br>namque uolans liquidis in nubibus arsit harundo<br>signauitque uiam flammis tenuisque recessit<br>consumpta in uentos, caelo ceu saepe refixa<br>transcurrunt crinemque uolantia sidera ducunt.<br>attonitis haesere animis superosque precati<br>Trinacrii Teucrique uiri, nec maximus omen<br>abnuit Aeneas, sed laetum amplexus Acesten<br>muneribus cumulat magnis ac talia fatur:<br>'sume, pater, nam te uoluit rex magnus Olympi<br>talibus auspiciis exsortem ducere honores.<br>ipsius Anchisae longaeui hoc munus habebis,<br>cratera impressum signis, quem Thracius olim<br>Anchisae genitori in magno munere Cisseus<br>ferre sui dederat monimentum et pignus amoris.'<br>sic fatus cingit uiridanti tempora lauro<br>et primum ante omnis uictorem appellat Acesten.<br>nec bonus Eurytion praelato inuidit honori,<br>quamuis solus auem caelo deiecit ab alto.<br>proximus ingreditur donis qui uincula rupit,<br>extremus uolucri qui fixit harundine malum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But lord Aeneas, ere yet the contest is sped, calls to him Epytides, guardian and attendant of ungrown IÃ¼lus, and thus speaks into his faithful ear: "Up and away, and tell Ascanius, if he now holds his band of boys ready, and their horses arrayed for the charge, to defile his squadrons to his grandsire's honour in bravery of arms." So says he, and himself bids all the crowding throng withdraw from the long racecourse and leave the lists free. The boys move in before their parents' faces, glittering in rank on their bitted horses; as they go all the people of Troy and Trinacria murmur and admire. On the hair of them all rests a garland fitly trimmed; each carries two cornel spear-shafts tipped with steel; some have polished quivers on their shoulders; above their breast and round their neck goes a flexible circlet of twisted gold. Three in number are the troops of riders, and three captains gallop up and down; following each in equal command rides a glittering division of twelve boys. One youthful line goes rejoicingly behind little Priam, renewer of his grandsire's name, thy renowned seed, O Polites, and destined to people Italy; he rides a Thracian horse dappled with spots of white, showing white on his pacing pasterns and white on his high forehead. Second is Atys, from whom the Latin Atii draw their line, little Atys, boy beloved of the boy IÃ¼lus. Last and excellent in beauty before them all, IÃ¼lus rode in on a Sidonian horse that Dido the bright had given him for token and pledge of love. The rest of them are mounted on old Acestes' Sicilian horsesâ€¦ The Dardanians greet their shy entrance with applause, and rejoice at the view, and recognise the features of their parents of old. When they have ridden merrily round all the concourse of their gazing friends, Epytides shouts from afar the signal they await, and sounds his whip. They gallop apart in equal numbers, and open their files three and three in deploying bands, and again at the call wheel about and bear down with levelled arms. Next they start on other charges and other retreats in corresponsive spaces, and interlink circle with circle, and wage the armed phantom of battle. And now they bare their backs in flight, now turn their lances to the charge, now plight peace and ride on side by side. As once of old, they say, the labyrinth in high Crete had a tangled path between blind walls, and a thousand ways of doubling treachery, where tokens to follow failed in the maze unmastered and irrecoverable: even in such a track do the children of Troy entangle their footsteps and weave the game of flight and battle; like dolphins who, swimming through the wet seas, cut Carpathian or Libyanâ€¦ <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At pater Aeneas nondum certamine misso<br>custodem ad sese comitemque impubis Iuli<br>Epytiden uocat, et fidam sic fatur ad aurem:<br>'uade age et Ascanio, si iam puerile paratum<br>agmen habet secum cursusque instruxit equorum,<br>ducat auo turmas et sese ostendat in armis<br>dic' ait. ipse omnem longo decedere circo<br>infusum populum et campos iubet esse patentis.<br>incedunt pueri pariterque ante ora parentum<br>frenatis lucent in equis, quos omnis euntis<br>Trinacriae mirata fremit Troiaeque iuuentus.<br>omnibus in morem tonsa coma pressa corona;<br>cornea bina ferunt praefixa hastilia ferro,<br>pars leuis umero pharetras; it pectore summo<br>flexilis obtorti per collum circulus auri.<br>tres equitum numero turmae ternique uagantur<br>ductores; pueri bis seni quemque secuti<br>agmine partito fulgent paribusque magistris.<br>una acies iuuenum, ducit quam paruus ouantem<br>nomen aui referens Priamus, tua clara, Polite,<br>progenies, auctura Italos; quem Thracius albis<br>portat equus bicolor maculis, uestigia primi<br>alba pedis frontemque ostentans arduus albam.<br>alter Atys, genus unde Atii duxere Latini,<br>paruus Atys pueroque puer dilectus Iulo.<br>extremus formaque ante omnis pulcher Iulus<br>Sidonio est inuectus equo, quem candida Dido<br>esse sui dederat monimentum et pignus amoris.<br>cetera Trinacriis pubes senioris Acestae<br>fertur equis.<br>excipiunt plausu pauidos gaudentque tuentes<br>Dardanidae, ueterumque agnoscunt ora parentum.<br>postquam omnem laeti consessum oculosque suorum<br>lustrauere in equis, signum clamore paratis<br>Epytides longe dedit insonuitque flagello.<br>olli discurrere pares atque agmina terni<br>diductis soluere choris, rursusque uocati<br>conuertere uias infestaque tela tulere.<br>inde alios ineunt cursus aliosque recursus<br>aduersi spatiis, alternosque orbibus orbis<br>impediunt pugnaeque cient simulacra sub armis;<br>et nunc terga fuga nudant, nunc spicula uertunt<br>infensi, facta pariter nunc pace feruntur.<br>ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta<br>parietibus textum caecis iter ancipitemque<br>mille uiis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi<br>frangeret indeprensus et inremeabilis error;<br>haud alio Teucrum nati uestigia cursu<br>impediunt texuntque fugas et proelia ludo,<br>delphinum similes qui per maria umida nando<br>Carpathium Libycumque secant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This fashion of riding, these games Ascanius first revived, when he girt Alba the Long about with walls, and taught their celebration to the Old Latins in the way of his own boyhood, with the youth of Troy about him. The Albans taught it their children; on from them mighty Rome received it and kept the ancestral observance; and now it is called Troy, and the boys the Trojan troop. Thus far sped the sacred contests to their holy lord. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">hunc morem cursus atque haec certamina primus<br>Ascanius, Longam muris cum cingeret Albam,<br>rettulit et priscos docuit celebrare Latinos,<br>quo puer ipse modo, secum quo Troia pubes;<br>Albani docuere suos; hinc maxima porro<br>accepit Roma et patrium seruauit honorem;<br>Troiaque nunc pueri, Troianum dicitur agmen.<br>hac celebrata tenus sancto certamina patri.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Just at this Fortune broke faith and grew estranged. While they pay the due rites to the tomb with diverse games, Juno, daughter of Saturn, sends Iris down the sky to the Ilian fleet, and breathes a gale to speed her on, revolving many a thought, and not yet satiate of the ancient pain. She, speeding her way along the thousand-coloured bow, runs swiftly, seen of none, down her maiden path. She discerns the vast concourse, and traverses the shore, and sees the haven abandoned and the fleet left alone. But far withdrawn by the solitary verge of the sea the Trojan women wept their lost Anchises, and as they wept gazed all together on the fathomless flood. "Alas! after all those weary waterways, that so wide a sea is yet to come!" such is the single cry of all. They pray for a city, sick of the burden of their sea-sorrow. So she darts among them, not witless to harm, and lays by face and raiment of a goddess: she becomes BeroÃ«, the aged wife of Tmarian Doryclus, who had once had birth and name and children, and in this guise goes among the Dardanian matrons. "Ah, wretched we," she cries, "whom hostile Achaean hands did not drag to death beneath our native city! ah hapless race, for what destruction does Fortune hold thee back? The seventh summer now declines since Troy's overthrow, while we pass measuring out by so many stars the harbourless rocks over every water and land, pursuing all the while over the vast sea an Italy that flies us, and tossing on the waves. Here are our brother Eryx' borders, and Acestes' welcome: who denies us to cast up walls and give our citizens a city? O country, O household gods vainly rescued from the foe! shall there never be a Trojan town to tell of? shall I nowhere see a Xanthus and a SimoÃ¯s, the rivers of Hector? Nay, up and join me in burning with fire these ill-ominous ships. For in sleep the phantom of Cassandra the soothsayer seemed to give me blazing brands: <i>Here seek your Troy</i>, she said; <i>here is your home</i>. Now is the time to do it; nor do these high portents allow delay. Behold four altars to Neptune; the god himself lends the firebrand and the nerve." Speaking thus, at once she strongly seizes the fiery weapon, and with straining hand whirls it far upreared, and flings: the souls of the Ilian women are startled and their wits amazed. At this one of their multitude, and she the eldest, Pyrgo, nurse in the palace to all Priam's many children: "This is not BeroÃ«, I tell you, O mothers; this is not the wife of Doryclus of Rhoeteum. Mark the lineaments of divine grace and the gleaming eyes, what a breath is hers, what a countenance, and the sound of her voice and the steps of her going. I, I time agone left BeroÃ« apart, sick and fretting that she alone must have no part in this our service, nor pay Anchises his due sacrifice." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hinc primum Fortuna fidem mutata nouauit.<br>dum uariis tumulo referunt sollemnia ludis,<br>Irim de caelo misit Saturnia Iuno<br>Iliacam ad classem uentosque aspirat eunti,<br>multa mouens necdum antiquum saturata dolorem.<br>illa uiam celerans per mille coloribus arcum<br>nulli uisa cito decurrit tramite uirgo.<br>conspicit ingentem concursum et litora lustrat<br>desertosque uidet portus classemque relictam.<br>at procul in sola secretae Troades acta<br>amissum Anchisen flebant, cunctaeque profundum<br>pontum aspectabant flentes. heu tot uada fessis<br>et tantum superesse maris, uox omnibus una;<br>urbem orant, taedet pelagi perferre laborem.<br>ergo inter medias sese haud ignara nocendi<br>conicit et faciemque deae uestemque reponit;<br>fit Beroe, Tmarii coniunx longaeua Dorycli,<br>cui genus et quondam nomen natique fuissent,<br>ac sic Dardanidum mediam se matribus infert.<br>'o miserae, quas non manus' inquit 'Achaica bello<br>traxerit ad letum patriae sub moenibus! o gens<br>infelix, cui te exitio Fortuna reseruat?<br>septima post Troiae excidium iam uertitur aestas,<br>cum freta, cum terras omnis, tot inhospita saxa<br>sideraque emensae ferimur, dum per mare magnum<br>Italiam sequimur fugientem et uoluimur undis.<br>hic Erycis fines fraterni atque hospes Acestes:<br>quis prohibet muros iacere et dare ciuibus urbem?<br>o patria et rapti nequiquam ex hoste penates,<br>nullane iam Troiae dicentur moenia? nusquam<br>Hectoreos amnis, Xanthum et Simoenta, uidebo?<br>quin agite et mecum infaustas exurite puppis.<br>nam mihi Cassandrae per somnum uatis imago<br>ardentis dare uisa faces: "hic quaerite Troiam;<br>hic domus est" inquit "uobis." iam tempus agi res,<br>nec tantis mora prodigiis. en quattuor arae<br>Neptuno; deus ipse faces animumque ministrat.'<br>haec memorans prima infensum ui corripit ignem<br>sublataque procul dextra conixa coruscat<br>et iacit. arrectae mentes stupefactaque corda<br>Iliadum. hic una e multis, quae maxima natu,<br>Pyrgo, tot Priami natorum regia nutrix:<br>'non Beroe uobis, non haec Rhoeteia, matres,<br>est Dorycli coniunx; diuini signa decoris<br>ardentisque notate oculos, qui spiritus illi,<br>qui uultus uocisque sonus uel gressus eunti.<br>ipsa egomet dudum Beroen digressa reliqui<br>aegram, indignantem tali quod sola careret<br>munere nec meritos Anchisae inferret honores.'<br>haec effata.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So spoke sheâ€¦ But the matrons at first, dubious and wavering, gazed on the ships with malignant eyes, between the wretched longing for the land they trod and the fated realm that summoned them: when the goddess rose through the sky on poised wings, and in her flight drew a vast bow beneath the clouds. Then indeed, amazed at the tokens and driven by madness, they raise a cry and snatch fire from the hearths within; others plunder the altars, and cast on brushwood boughs and brands. The Fire-god rages with loose rein over thwarts and oars and hulls of painted fir. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">at matres primo ancipites oculisque malignis<br>ambiguae spectare rates miserum inter amorem<br>praesentis terrae fatisque uocantia regna,<br>cum dea se paribus per caelum sustulit alis<br>ingentemque fuga secuit sub nubibus arcum.<br>tum uero attonitae monstris actaeque furore<br>conclamant, rapiuntque focis penetralibus ignem,<br>pars spoliant aras, frondem ac uirgulta facesque<br>coniciunt. furit immissis Volcanus habenis<br>transtra per et remos et pictas abiete puppis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Eumelus carries the news of the burning ships to the grave of Anchises and the ranges of the theatre; and looking back, their own eyes see the floating cloud of dark ashes. And in a moment Ascanius, as he rode gaily before his cavalry, spurred his horse to the disordered camp; nor can his breathless guardians hold him back. "What strange madness is this?" he cries; "whither now hasten you, whither, alas and woe! O citizens? not on the foe nor on some hostile Argive camp; it is your own hopes you burn. Behold me, your Ascanius!" and he flung before his feet the empty helmet, put on when he roused the mimicry of war. Aeneas and the Trojan train together hurry to the spot. But the women scatter apart in fear all over the beach, and stealthily seek the woods and the hollow rocks they find: they loathe their deed and the daylight, and with changed eyes know their people, and Juno is startled out of their breast. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nuntius Anchisae ad tumulum cuneosque theatri<br>incensas perfert nauis Eumelus, et ipsi<br>respiciunt atram in nimbo uolitare fauillam.<br>primus et Ascanius, cursus ut laetus equestris<br>ducebat, sic acer equo turbata petiuit<br>castra, nec exanimes possunt retinere magistri.<br>'quis furor iste nouus? quo nunc, quo tenditis' inquit<br>'heu miserae ciues? non hostem inimicaque castra<br>Argiuum, uestras spes uritis. en, ego uester<br>Ascanius!'â€”galeam ante pedes proiecit inanem,<br>qua ludo indutus belli simulacra ciebat.<br>accelerat simul Aeneas, simul agmina Teucrum.<br>ast illae diuersa metu per litora passim<br>diffugiunt, siluasque et sicubi concaua furtim<br>saxa petunt; piget incepti lucisque, suosque<br>mutatae agnoscunt excussaque pectore Iuno est.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But not thereby do the flames of the burning lay down their unconquered strength; under the wet oak the seams are alive, spouting slow coils of smoke; the creeping heat devours the hulls, and the destroyer takes deep hold of all: nor does the heroes' strength avail nor the floods they pour in. Then good Aeneas rent away the raiment from his shoulders and called the gods to aid, stretching forth his hands: "Jupiter omnipotent, if thou hatest not Troy yet wholly to her last man, if thine ancient pity looks at all on human woes, now, O Lord, grant our fleet to escape the flame, and rescue from doom the slender Teucrian estate. Or do thou plunge to death this remnant, if I deserve it, with levelled thunderbolt, and here with thine own hand smite us down." Scarce had he uttered this, when a black tempest rages in streaming showers; earth trembles to the thunder on plain and steep; the water-flood rushes in torrents from the whole heaven amid black darkness and volleying blasts of the South. The ships are filled from overhead, the half-burnt timbers are soaking; till all the heat is quenched, and all the hulls, but four that are lost, are rescued from destruction. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Sed non idcirco flamma atque incendia uiris<br>indomitas posuere; udo sub robore uiuit<br>stuppa uomens tardum fumum, lentusque carinas<br>est uapor et toto descendit corpore pestis,<br>nec uires heroum infusaque flumina prosunt.<br>tum pius Aeneas umeris abscindere uestem<br>auxilioque uocare deos et tendere palmas:<br>'Iuppiter omnipotens, si nondum exosus ad unum<br>Troianos, si quid pietas antiqua labores<br>respicit humanos, da flammam euadere classi<br>nunc, pater, et tenuis Teucrum res eripe leto.<br>uel tu, quod superest, infesto fulmine morti,<br>si mereor, demitte tuaque hic obrue dextra.'<br>uix haec ediderat cum effusis imbribus atra<br>tempestas sine more furit tonitruque tremescunt<br>ardua terrarum et campi; ruit aethere toto<br>turbidus imber aqua densisque nigerrimus Austris,<br>implenturque super puppes, semusta madescunt<br>robora, restinctus donec uapor omnis et omnes<br>quattuor amissis seruatae a peste carinae.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But lord Aeneas, dismayed by the bitter mischance, revolved at heart this way and that his shifting weight of care, whether, forgetting fate, he should rest in Sicilian fields, or reach forth to the borders of Italy.

He ended, and retreated like a vapour into thin air. "Ah, whither hurriest thou?" cries Aeneas; "whither so fast away? From whom fliest thou? or who withholds thee from our embrace?" So speaking, he kindles the sleeping embers of the fire, and with holy meal and laden censer does sacrifice to the tutelar of Pergama and hoar Vesta's secret shrine. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'nate, mihi uita quondam, dum uita manebat,<br>care magis, nate Iliacis exercite fatis,<br>imperio Iouis huc uenio, qui classibus ignem<br>depulit, et caelo tandem miseratus ab alto est.<br>consiliis pare quae nunc pulcherrima Nautes<br>dat senior; lectos iuuenes, fortissima corda,<br>defer in Italiam. gens dura atque aspera cultu<br>debellanda tibi Latio est.

The rest repair the thwarts and replace the ships' timbers that the flames had gnawed upon, and fit up oars and rigging, little in number, but alive and valiant for war. Meanwhile Aeneas traces the town with the plough and allots the homesteads; this he bids be Ilium, and these lands Troy. Trojan Acestes, rejoicing in his kingdom, appoints a court and gathers his senators to give them statutes. Next, where the crest of Eryx is neighbour to the stars, a dwelling is founded to Venus the Idalian; and a priest and breadth of holy wood is attached to Anchises' grave. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Extemplo socios primumque accersit Acesten<br>et Iouis imperium et cari praecepta parentis<br>edocet et quae nunc animo sententia constet.<br>haud mora consiliis, nec iussa recusat Acestes:<br>transcribunt urbi matres populumque uolentem<br>deponunt, animos nil magnae laudis egentis.<br>ipsi transtra nouant flammisque ambesa reponunt<br>robora nauigiis, aptant remosque rudentisque,<br>exigui numero, sed bello uiuida uirtus.<br>interea Aeneas urbem designat aratro<br>sortiturque domos; hoc Ilium et haec loca Troiam<br>esse iubet. gaudet regno Troianus Acestes<br>indicitque forum et patribus dat iura uocatis.<br>tum uicina astris Erycino in uertice sedes<br>fundatur Veneri Idaliae, tumuloque sacerdos<br>ac lucus late sacer additus Anchiseo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now for nine days all the people hath feasted, and offering been paid at the altars; quiet breezes have smoothed the ocean floor, and the gathering south wind blows, calling them again to sea. A mighty weeping arises along the winding shore; a night and a day they linger in mutual embraces. The very mothers now, the very men to whom once the sight of the sea seemed cruel and the name intolerable, would go on and endure the journey's travail to the end. These Aeneas comforts with kindly words, and commends with tears to his kinsman Acestes' care. Then he bids slay three steers to Eryx and a she-lamb to the Tempests, and loose the hawser as is due. Himself, his head bound with stripped leaves of olive, he stands apart on the prow holding the cup, and casts the entrails into the salt flood and pours liquid wine.

When Achilles pursued the Trojan armies and hurled them breathless on their walls, and sent many thousands to death,â€”when the choked rivers groaned and Xanthus could not find passage or roll out to sea,â€”then I snatched Aeneas away in sheltering mist as he met the brave son of Peleus outmatched in strength and gods, eager as I was to overthrow the walls of perjured Troy that mine own hands had built. Now too my mind rests the same; dismiss thy fear. In safety, as thou desirest, shall he reach the haven of Avernus.

Then their lord yokes his wild horses with gold and fastens the foaming bits, and letting all the reins run slack in his hand, flies lightly in his sea-coloured chariot over the ocean surface. The waves sink to rest, and the swoln water-ways smooth out under the thundering axle; the storm-clouds scatter from the vast sky. Diverse shapes attend him, monstrous whales, and Glaucus' aged choir, and Palaemon, son of Ino, the swift Tritons, and Phorcus with all his army. Thetis and Melite keep the left, and maiden Panopea, Nesaea and Spio, Thalia and Cymodoce. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">his ubi laeta deae permulsit pectora dictis,<br>iungit equos auro genitor, spumantiaque addit<br>frena feris manibusque omnis effundit habenas.<br>caeruleo per summa leuis uolat aequora curru;<br>subsidunt undae tumidumque sub axe tonanti<br>sternitur aequor aquis, fugiunt uasto aethere nimbi.<br>tum uariae comitum facies, immania cete,<br>et senior Glauci chorus Inousque Palaemon<br>Tritonesque citi Phorcique exercitus omnis;<br>laeua tenet Thetis et Melite Panopeaque uirgo,<br>Nisaee Spioque Thaliaque Cymodoceque.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>At this lord Aeneas' soul is thrilled with soft counterchange of delight. He bids all the masts be upreared with speed, and the sails stretched on the yards. Together all set their sheets, and all at once slacken their canvas to left and again to right; together they brace and unbrace the yard-arms aloft; prosperous gales waft the fleet along. First, in front of all, Palinurus steered the close column; the rest under orders ply their course by his. And now dewy Night had just reached heaven's mid-cone; the sailors, stretched on their hard benches under the oars, relaxed their limbs in quiet rest: when Sleep, sliding lightly down from the starry sky, parted the shadowy air and cleft the dark, seeking thee, O Palinurus, carrying dreams of bale to thee who dreamt not of harm, and lit on the high stern, a god in Phorbas' likeness, dropping this speech from his lips: "Palinurus son of Iasus, the very seas bear our fleet along; the breezes breathe steadily; for an hour rest is given. Lay down thine head, and steal thy worn eyes from their toil. I myself for a little will take thy duty in thy stead." To whom Palinurus, scarcely lifting his eyes, returns: "Wouldst thou have me ignorant what the calm face of the brine means, and the waves at rest? Shall I have faith in this perilous thing? How shall I trust Aeneas to deceitful breezes, and the placid treachery of sky that hath so often deceived me?" Such words he uttered, and, clinging fast to the tiller, slackened hold no whit, and looked up steadily on the stars. Lo! the god shakes over either temple a bough dripping with Lethean dew and made slumberous with the might of Styx, and makes his swimming eyes relax their struggles. Scarcely had sleep begun to slacken his limbs unaware, when bending down, he flung him sheer into the clear water, tearing rudder and half the stern away with him, and many a time crying vainly on his comrades: himself he rose on flying wings into the thin air. None the less does the fleet run safe on its sea path, and glides on unalarmed in lord Neptune's assurance. Yes, and now they were sailing in to the cliffs of the Sirens, dangerous once of old and white with the bones of many a man; and the hoarse rocks echoed afar in the ceaseless surf; when her lord felt the ship rocking astray for loss of her helmsman, and himself steered her on over the darkling water, sighing often the while, and heavy at heart for his friend's mischance. "Ah too trustful in sky's and sea's serenity, thou shalt lie, O Palinurus, naked on an alien sand!" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic patris Aeneae suspensam blanda uicissim<br>gaudia pertemptant mentem; iubet ocius omnis<br>attolli malos, intendi bracchia uelis.<br>una omnes fecere pedem pariterque sinistros,<br>nunc dextros soluere sinus; una ardua torquent<br>cornua detorquentque; ferunt sua flamina classem.<br>princeps ante omnis densum Palinurus agebat<br>agmen; ad hunc alii cursum contendere iussi.<br>iamque fere mediam caeli Nox umida metam<br>contigerat, placida laxabant membra quiete<br>sub remis fusi per dura sedilia nautae,<br>cum leuis aetheriis delapsus Somnus ab astris<br>aera dimouit tenebrosum et dispulit umbras,<br>te, Palinure, petens, tibi somnia tristia portans<br>insonti; puppique deus consedit in alta<br>Phorbanti similis funditque has ore loquelas:<br>'Iaside Palinure, ferunt ipsa aequora classem,<br>aequatae spirant aurae, datur hora quieti.<br>pone caput fessosque oculos furare labori.<br>ipse ego paulisper pro te tua munera inibo.'<br>cui uix attollens Palinurus lumina fatur:<br>'mene salis placidi uultum fluctusque quietos<br>ignorare iubes? mene huic confidere monstro?<br>Aenean credam (quid enim?) fallacibus auris<br>et caeli totiens deceptus fraude sereni?'<br>talia dicta dabat, clauumque adfixus et haerens<br>nusquam amittebat oculosque sub astra tenebat.<br>ecce deus ramum Lethaeo rore madentem<br>uique soporatum Stygia super utraque quassat<br>tempora, cunctantique natantia lumina soluit.<br>uix primos inopina quies laxauerat artus,<br>et super incumbens cum puppis parte reuulsa<br>cumque gubernaclo liquidas proiecit in undas<br>praecipitem ac socios nequiquam saepe uocantem;<br>ipse uolans tenuis se sustulit ales ad auras.<br>currit iter tutum non setius aequore classis<br>promissisque patris Neptuni interrita fertur.<br>iamque adeo scopulos Sirenum aduecta subibat,<br>difficilis quondam multorumque ossibus albos<br>(tum rauca adsiduo longe sale saxa sonabant),<br>cum pater amisso fluitantem errare magistro<br>sensit, et ipse ratem nocturnis rexit in undis<br>multa gemens casuque animum concussus amici:<br>'o nimium caelo et pelago confise sereno,<br>nudus in ignota, Palinure, iacebis harena.'</rtc></ruby></p><nav><a href="#!/aeneid/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/aeneid/book4/" rel="prev">Previous</a> <a href="#!/aeneid/book6/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><small>Translated by <u>J.
