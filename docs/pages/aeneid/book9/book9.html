To him the child of Thaumas spoke thus with roseate lips: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Atque ea diuersa penitus dum parte geruntur,<br>Irim de caelo misit Saturnia Iuno<br>audacem ad Turnum. luco tum forte parentis<br>Pilumni Turnus sacrata ualle sedebat.<br>ad quem sic roseo Thaumantias ore locuta est:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Turnus, what no god had dared promise to thy prayer, behold, is brought unasked by the circling day. Aeneas hath quitted town and comrades and fleet to seek Evander's throne and Palatine dwelling-place. Nor is it enough; he hath pierced to Corythus' utmost cities, and is mustering in arms a troop of Lydian rustics. Why hesitate? now, now is the time to call for chariot and horses. Break through all hindrance and seize the bewildered camp." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Turne, quod optanti diuum promittere nemo<br>auderet, uoluenda dies en attulit ultro.<br>Aeneas urbe et sociis et classe relicta<br>sceptra Palatini sedemque petit Euandri.<br>nec satis: extremas Corythi penetrauit ad urbes<br>Lydorumque manum, collectos armat agrestis.<br>quid dubitas? nunc tempus equos, nunc poscere currus.<br>rumpe moras omnis et turbata arripe castra.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>She spoke, and rose into the sky on poised wings, and flashed under the clouds in a long flying bow. He knew her, and lifting either hand to heaven, with this cry pursued her flight: "Iris, grace of the sky, who hath driven thee down the clouds to me and borne thee to earth? Whence is this sudden sheen of weather? I see the sky parting asunder, and the wandering stars in the firmament. I follow the high omen, whoso thou art that callest me to arms." And with these words he drew nigh the wave, and caught up water from its brimming eddy, making many prayers to the gods and burdening the air with vows. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">dixit, et in caelum paribus se sustulit alis<br>ingentemque fuga secuit sub nubibus arcum.<br>agnouit iuuenis duplicisque ad sidera palmas<br>sustulit ac tali fugientem est uoce secutus:<br>'Iri, decus caeli, quis te mihi nubibus actam<br>detulit in terras? unde haec tam clara repente<br>tempestas? medium uideo discedere caelum<br>palantisque polo stellas. sequor omina tanta,<br>quisquis in arma uocas.' et sic effatus ad undam<br>processit summoque hausit de gurgite lymphas<br>multa deos orans, onerauitque aethera uotis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now all the army was advancing on the open plain, rich in horses, rich in raiment of broidered gold. Messapus rules the foremost ranks, the sons of Tyrrheus the rear. Turnus commands the centre: even as Ganges rising high in silence when his seven streams are still, or the rich flood of Nile when he ebbs from the plains, and is now sunk into his channel. On this the Teucrians descry a sudden cloud of dark dust gathering, and the blackness rising on the plain. Caïcus raises a cry from the mound in front: "What mass of misty gloom, O citizens, is rolling hitherward? to arms in haste! serve out weapons, climb the walls. The enemy approaches, ho!" With mighty clamour the Teucrians pour in through all the gates and fill the works. For so at his departure Aeneas the great captain had enjoined; were aught to chance meanwhile, they should not venture to range their line or trust the plain, but keep their camp and the safety of the entrenched walls. So, though shame and wrath beckon them on to battle, they yet bar the gates and do his bidding, and await the foe armed and in shelter of the towers. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque omnis campis exercitus ibat apertis<br>diues equum, diues pictai uestis et auri;<br>Messapus primas acies, postrema coercent<br>Tyrrhidae iuuenes, medio dux agmine Turnus:<br>ceu septem surgens sedatis amnibus altus<br>per tacitum Ganges aut pingui flumine Nilus<br>cum refluit campis et iam se condidit alueo.<br>hic subitam nigro glomerari puluere nubem<br>prospiciunt Teucri ac tenebras insurgere campis.<br>primus ab aduersa conclamat mole Caicus:<br>'quis globus, o ciues, caligine uoluitur atra?<br>ferte citi ferrum, date tela, ascendite muros,<br>hostis adest, heia!' ingenti clamore per omnis<br>condunt se Teucri portas et moenia complent.<br>namque ita discedens praeceperat optimus armis<br>Aeneas: si qua interea fortuna fuisset,<br>neu struere auderent aciem neu credere campo;<br>castra modo et tutos seruarent aggere muros.<br>ergo etsi conferre manum pudor iraque monstrat,<br>obiciunt portas tamen et praecepta facessunt,<br>armatique cauis exspectant turribus hostem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Turnus, who had flown forward in advance of his tardy column, comes up suddenly to the town with a train of twenty chosen cavalry, borne on a Thracian horse dappled with white, and covered by a golden helmet with scarlet plume. "Who will be with me, my men, to be first on the foe? See!" he cries; and sends a javelin spinning into the air to open battle, and advances towering on the plain. His comrades take up the cry, and follow with dreadful din, wondering at the Teucrians' coward hearts, that they issue not on even field nor face them in arms, but keep in shelter of the camp. Hither and thither he rides furiously, tracing the walls, and seeking entrance where way is none. And as a wolf prowling about some crowded sheepfold, when, beaten sore of winds and rains, he howls at the pens by midnight; safe beneath their mothers the lambs keep bleating on; he, savage and insatiate, rages in anger against the flock he cannot reach, tired by the long-gathering madness for food, and the throat unslaked with blood: even so the Rutulian, as he gazes on the walled camp, kindles in anger, and indignation is hot in his iron frame. By what means may he essay entrance? by what passage hurl the imprisoned Trojans from the rampart and fling them on the plain? Close under the flanking camp lay the fleet, fenced about with mounds and the waters of the river; it he attacks, and calls for fire to his exultant comrades, and eagerly catches a blazing pine-torch in his hand. Then indeed they press on, quickened by Turnus' presence, and all the band arm them with black faggots. The hearth-fires are plundered; the smoky brand trails a resinous glare, and the Fire-god sends clouds of glowing ashes upward. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Turnus, ut ante uolans tardum praecesserat agmen<br>uiginti lectis equitum comitatus et urbi<br>improuisus adest, maculis quem Thracius albis<br>portat equus cristaque tegit galea aurea rubra,<br>'ecquis erit mecum, iuuenes, qui primus in hostem—?<br>en,' ait et iaculum attorquens emittit in auras,<br>principium pugnae, et campo sese arduus infert.<br>clamorem excipiunt socii fremituque sequuntur<br>horrisono; Teucrum mirantur inertia corda,<br>non aequo dare se campo, non obuia ferre<br>arma uiros, sed castra fouere. huc turbidus atque huc<br>lustrat equo muros aditumque per auia quaerit.<br>ac ueluti pleno lupus insidiatus ouili<br>cum fremit ad caulas uentos perpessus et imbris<br>nocte super media; tuti sub matribus agni<br>balatum exercent, ille asper et improbus ira<br>saeuit in absentis; collecta fatigat edendi<br>ex longo rabies et siccae sanguine fauces:<br>haud aliter Rutulo muros et castra tuenti<br>ignescunt irae, duris dolor ossibus ardet.<br>qua temptet ratione aditus, et quae uia clausos<br>excutiat Teucros uallo atque effundat in aequum?<br>classem, quae lateri castrorum adiuncta latebat,<br>aggeribus saeptam circum et fluuialibus undis,<br>inuadit sociosque incendia poscit ouantis<br>atque manum pinu flagranti feruidus implet.<br>tum uero incumbunt (urget praesentia Turni),<br>atque omnis facibus pubes accingitur atris.<br>diripuere focos: piceum fert fumida lumen<br>taeda et commixtam Volcanus ad astra fauillam.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>What god, O Muses, guarded the Trojans from the rage of the fire? who repelled the fierce flame from their ships? Tell it; ancient is the assurance thereof, but the fame everlasting. What time Aeneas began to shape his fleet on Phrygian Ida, and prepared to seek the high seas, the Berecyntian, they say, the very Mother of gods, spoke to high Jove in these words: "Grant, O son, to my prayer, what her dearness claims who bore thee and laid Olympus under thy feet. My pine forest beloved of me these many years, my grove was on the mountain's crown, whither men bore my holy things, dim with dusky pine and pillared maples. These, when he required a fleet, I gave gladly to the Dardanian; now fear wrings me with sharp distress. Relieve my terrors, and grant a mother's prayers such power that they may yield to no stress of voyaging or of stormy gust: be birth on our hills their avail." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Quis deus, o Musae, tam saeua incendia Teucris<br>auertit? tantos ratibus quis depulit ignis?<br>dicite: prisca fides facto, sed fama perennis.<br>tempore quo primum Phrygia formabat in Ida<br>Aeneas classem et pelagi petere alta parabat,<br>ipsa deum fertur genetrix Berecyntia magnum<br>uocibus his adfata Iouem: 'da, nate, petenti,<br>quod tua cara parens domito te poscit Olympo.<br>pinea silua mihi multos dilecta per annos,<br>lucus in arce fuit summa, quo sacra ferebant,<br>nigranti picea trabibusque obscurus acernis.<br>has ego Dardanio iuueni, cum classis egeret,<br>laeta dedi; nunc sollicitam timor anxius angit.<br>solue metus atque hoc precibus sine posse parentem,<br>ne cursu quassatae ullo neu turbine uenti<br>uincantur: prosit nostris in montibus ortas.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus her son in answer, who wheels the starry worlds: "O mother, whither callest thou fate? or what dost thou seek for these of thine? May hulls have the right of immortality that were fashioned by mortal hand? and may Aeneas traverse perils secure in insecurity? To what god is power so great given? Nay, but when, their duty done, they shall lie at last in their Ausonian haven, from all that have outgone the waves and borne their Dardanian captain to the fields of Laurentum, will I take their mortal body, and bid them be goddesses of the mighty deep, even as Doto the Nereïd and Galatea, when they cut the sea that falls away from their breasts in foam." He ended; and by his brother's Stygian streams, by the banks of the pitchy black-boiling chasm he nodded confirmation, and shook all Olympus with his nod. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">filius huic contra, torquet qui sidera mundi:<br>'o genetrix, quo fata uocas? aut quid petis istis?<br>mortaline manu factae immortale carinae<br>fas habeant? certusque incerta pericula lustret<br>Aeneas? cui tanta deo permissa potestas?<br>immo, ubi defunctae finem portusque tenebunt<br>Ausonios olim, quaecumque euaserit undis<br>Dardaniumque ducem Laurentia uexerit arua,<br>mortalem eripiam formam magnique iubebo<br>aequoris esse deas, qualis Nereia Doto<br>et Galatea secant spumantem pectore pontum.'<br>dixerat idque ratum Stygii per flumina fratris,<br>per pice torrentis atraque uoragine ripas<br>adnuit, et totum nutu tremefecit Olympum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So the promised day was come, and the destinies had fulfilled their due time, when Turnus' injury stirred the Mother to ward the brands from her holy ships. First then a strange light flashed on all eyes, and a great glory from the Dawn seemed to dart over the sky, with the choirs of Ida; then an awful voice fell through air, filling the Trojan and Rutulian ranks: "Disquiet not yourselves, O Teucrians, to guard ships of mine, neither arm your hands: sooner shall Turnus burn the seas than these holy pines. You, go free; go, goddesses of the sea; the Mother bids it." And immediately each ship breaks the bond that held it, as with dipping prows they plunge like dolphins deep into the water: from it again (O wonderful and strange!) they rise with maidens' faces in like number, and bear out to sea. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ergo aderat promissa dies et tempora Parcae<br>debita complerant, cum Turni iniuria Matrem<br>admonuit ratibus sacris depellere taedas.<br>hic primum noua lux oculis offulsit et ingens<br>uisus ab Aurora caelum transcurrere nimbus<br>Idaeique chori; tum uox horrenda per auras<br>excidit et Troum Rutulorumque agmina complet:<br>'ne trepidate meas, Teucri, defendere nauis<br>neue armate manus; maria ante exurere Turno<br>quam sacras dabitur pinus. uos ite solutae,<br>ite deae pelagi; genetrix iubet.' et sua quaeque<br>continuo puppes abrumpunt uincula ripis<br>delphinumque modo demersis aequora rostris<br>ima petunt. hinc uirgineae (mirabile monstrum)<br>reddunt se totidem facies pontoque feruntur.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The Rutulians stood dumb: Messapus himself is terror-stricken among his disordered cavalry; even the stream of Tiber pauses with hoarse murmur, and recoils from sea. But bold Turnus fails not a whit in confidence; nay, he raises their courage with words, nay, he chides them: "On the Trojans are these portents aimed; Jupiter himself hath bereft them of their wonted succour; nor do they abide Rutulian sword and fire. So are the seas pathless for the Teucrians, nor is there any hope in flight; they have lost half their world. And we hold the land: in all their thousands the nations of Italy are under arms. In no wise am I dismayed by those divine oracles of doom the Phrygians insolently advance. Fate and Venus are satisfied, in that the Trojans have touched our fruitful Ausonian fields. I too have my fate in reply to theirs, to put utterly to the sword the guilty nation who have robbed me of my bride; not the sons of Atreus alone are touched by that pain, nor may Mycenae only rise in arms. But to have perished once is enough! To have sinned once should have been enough, in all but utter hatred of the whole of womankind. Trust in the sundering rampart, and the hindrance of their trenches, so little between them and death, gives these their courage: yet have they not seen Troy town, the work of Neptune's hand, sink into fire? But you, my chosen, who of you makes ready to breach their palisade at the sword's point, and join my attack on their fluttered camp? I have no need of Vulcanian arms, of a thousand ships, to meet the Teucrians. All Etruria may join on with them in alliance: nor let them fear the darkness, and the cowardly theft of their Palladium, and the guards cut down on the fortress height. Nor will we hide ourselves unseen in a horse's belly; in daylight and unconcealed are we resolved to girdle their walls with flame. Not with Grecians will I make them think they have to do, nor a Pelasgic force kept off till the tenth year by Hector. Now, since the better part of day is spent, for what remains refresh your bodies, glad that we have done so well, and expect the order of battle." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Obstipuere animis Rutuli, conterritus ipse<br>turbatis Messapus equis, cunctatur et amnis<br>rauca sonans reuocatque pedem Tiberinus ab alto.<br>at non audaci Turno fiducia cessit;<br>ultro animos tollit dictis atque increpat ultro:<br>'Troianos haec monstra petunt, his Iuppiter ipse<br>auxilium solitum eripuit: non tela neque ignis<br>exspectant Rutulos. ergo maria inuia Teucris,<br>nec spes ulla fugae: rerum pars altera adempta est,<br>terra autem in nostris manibus, tot milia gentes<br>arma ferunt Italae. nil me fatalia terrent,<br>si qua Phryges prae se iactant, responsa deorum;<br>sat fatis Venerique datum, tetigere quod arua<br>fertilis Ausoniae Troes. sunt et mea contra<br>fata mihi, ferro sceleratam exscindere gentem<br>coniuge praerepta; nec solos tangit Atridas<br>iste dolor, solisque licet capere arma Mycenis.<br>"sed periisse semel satis est": peccare fuisset<br>ante satis, penitus modo non genus omne perosos<br>femineum. quibus haec medii fiducia ualli<br>fossarumque morae, leti discrimina parua,<br>dant animos; at non uiderunt moenia Troiae<br>Neptuni fabricata manu considere in ignis?<br>sed uos, o lecti, ferro qui scindere uallum<br>apparat et mecum inuadit trepidantia castra?<br>non armis mihi Volcani, non mille carinis<br>est opus in Teucros. addant se protinus omnes<br>Etrusci socios. tenebras et inertia furta<br>Palladii caesis late custodibus arcis<br>ne timeant, nec equi caeca condemur in aluo:<br>luce palam certum est igni circumdare muros.<br>haud sibi cum Danais rem faxo et pube Pelasga<br>esse ferant, decimum quos distulit Hector in annum.<br>nunc adeo, melior quoniam pars acta diei,<br>quod superest, laeti bene gestis corpora rebus<br>procurate, uiri, et pugnam sperate parari.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile charge is given to Messapus to blockade the gates with pickets of sentries, and encircle the works with watchfires. Twice seven are chosen to guard the walls with Rutulian soldiery; but each leads an hundred men, crimson-plumed and sparkling in gold. They spread themselves about and keep alternate watch, and, lying along the grass, drink deep and set brazen bowls atilt. The fires glow, and the sentinels spend the night awake in games… <rtc lang="la" translate="no">interea uigilum excubiis obsidere portas<br>cura datur Messapo et moenia cingere flammis.<br>bis septem Rutuli muros qui milite seruent<br>delecti, ast illos centeni quemque sequuntur<br>purpurei cristis iuuenes auroque corusci.<br>discurrunt uariantque uices, fusique per herbam<br>indulgent uino et uertunt crateras aenos.<br>conlucent ignes, noctem custodia ducit<br>insomnem ludo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Down on this the Trojans look forth from the rampart, as they hold the height in arms; withal in fearful haste they try the gates and lay gangways from bastion to bastion, and bring up missiles. Mnestheus and valiant Serestus speed the work, whom lord Aeneas appointed, should misfortune call, to be rulers of the people and governors of the state. All their battalions, sharing the lot of peril, keep watch along the walls, and take alternate charge of all that requires defence. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec super e uallo prospectant Troes et armis<br>alta tenent, nec non trepidi formidine portas<br>explorant pontisque et propugnacula iungunt,<br>tela gerunt. instat Mnestheus acerque Serestus,<br>quos pater Aeneas, si quando aduersa uocarent,<br>rectores iuuenum et rerum dedit esse magistros.<br>omnis per muros legio sortita periclum<br>excubat exercetque uices, quod cuique tuendum est.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>On guard at the gate was Nisus son of Hyrtacus, most valiant in arms, whom Ida the huntress had sent in Aeneas' company with fleet javelin and light arrows; and by his side Euryalus, fairest of all the Aeneadae and the wearers of Trojan arms, showing on his unshaven boy's face the first bloom of youth. These two were one in affection, and charged in battle together; now likewise their common guard kept the gate. Nisus cries: "Lend the gods this fervour to the soul, Euryalus? or does fatal passion become a proper god to each? Long ere now my soul is restless to begin some great deed of arms, and quiet peace delights it not. Thou seest how confident in fortune the Rutulians stand. Their lights glimmer far apart; buried in drunken sleep they have sunk to rest; silence stretches all about. Learn then what doubt, what purpose, now rises in my spirit. People and senate, they all cry that Aeneas be summoned, and men be sent to carry him tidings. If they promise what I ask in thy name—for to me the glory of the deed is enough—methinks I can find beneath yonder hillock a path to the walls of Pallanteum town." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nisus erat portae custos, acerrimus armis,<br>Hyrtacides, comitem Aeneae quem miserat Ida<br>uenatrix iaculo celerem leuibusque sagittis,<br>et iuxta comes Euryalus, quo pulchrior alter<br>non fuit Aeneadum Troiana neque induit arma,<br>ora puer prima signans intonsa iuuenta.<br>his amor unus erat pariterque in bella ruebant;<br>tum quoque communi portam statione tenebant.<br>Nisus ait: 'dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt,<br>Euryale, an sua cuique deus fit dira cupido?<br>aut pugnam aut aliquid iamdudum inuadere magnum<br>mens agitat mihi, nec placida contenta quiete est.<br>cernis quae Rutulos habeat fiducia rerum:<br>lumina rara micant, somno uinoque soluti<br>procubuere, silent late loca. percipe porro<br>quid dubitem et quae nunc animo sententia surgat.<br>Aenean acciri omnes, populusque patresque,<br>exposcunt, mittique uiros qui certa reportent.<br>si tibi quae posco promittunt (nam mihi facti<br>fama sat est), tumulo uideor reperire sub illo<br>posse uiam ad muros et moenia Pallantea.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Euryalus stood fixed, struck through with high ambition, and therewith speaks thus to his fervid friend: "Dost thou shun me then, Nisus, to share thy company in highest deeds? shall I send thee alone into so great perils? Not thus did my warrior father Opheltes rear and nurture me amid the Argive terror and the agony of Troy, nor thus have I borne myself by thy side while following noble Aeneas to his utmost fate. Here is a spirit, yes here, that scorns the light of day, that deems lightly bought at a life's price that honour to which thou dost aspire." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">obstipuit magno laudum percussus amore<br>Euryalus, simul his ardentem adfatur amicum:<br>'mene igitur socium summis adiungere rebus,<br>Nise, fugis? solum te in tanta pericula mittam?<br>non ita me genitor, bellis adsuetus Opheltes,<br>Argolicum terrorem inter Troiaeque labores<br>sublatum erudiit, nec tecum talia gessi<br>magnanimum Aenean et fata extrema secutus:<br>est hic, est animus lucis contemptor et istum<br>qui uita bene credat emi, quo tendis, honorem.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>To this Nisus: "Assuredly I had no such fear of thee; no, nor could I; so may great Jupiter, or whoso looks on earth with equal eyes, restore me to thee triumphant. But if haply—as thou seest often and often in so forlorn a hope—if haply chance or deity sweep me to adverse doom, I would have thee survive; thine age is worthier to live. Be there one to commit me duly to earth, rescued or ransomed from the battlefield: or, if fortune deny that, to pay me far away the rites of funeral and the grace of a tomb. Neither would I bring such pain on thy poor mother, she who singly of many matrons hath dared to follow her boy to the end, and slights great Acestes' city." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nisus ad haec: 'equidem de te nil tale uerebar,<br>nec fas; non ita me referat tibi magnus ouantem<br>Iuppiter aut quicumque oculis haec aspicit aequis.<br>sed si quis (quae multa uides discrimine tali)<br>si quis in aduersum rapiat casusue deusue,<br>te superesse uelim, tua uita dignior aetas.<br>sit qui me raptum pugna pretioue redemptum<br>mandet humo, solita aut si qua id Fortuna uetabit,<br>absenti ferat inferias decoretque sepulcro.<br>neu matri miserae tanti sim causa doloris,<br>quae te sola, puer, multis e matribus ausa<br>persequitur, magni nec moenia curat Acestae.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And he: "In vain dost thou string idle reasons; nor does my purpose yield or change its place so soon.

He speaks, and rouses the watch; they come up, and relieve the guard; quitting their post, he and Nisus stride on to seek the prince. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ille autem: 'causas nequiquam nectis inanis<br>nec mea iam mutata loco sententia cedit.<br>acceleremus' ait, uigiles simul excitat. illi<br>succedunt seruantque uices; statione relicta<br>ipse comes Niso graditur regemque requirunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The rest of living things over all lands were soothing their cares in sleep, and their hearts forgot their pain; the foremost Trojan captains, a chosen band, held council of state upon the kingdom; what should they do, or who would now be their messenger to Aeneas? They stand, leaning on their long spears and grasping their shields, in mid level of the camp. Then Nisus and Euryalus together pray with quick urgency to be given audience; their matter is weighty and will be worth the delay. Iülus at once heard their hurried plea, and bade Nisus speak. Thereon the son of Hyrtacus: "Hear, O people of Aeneas, with favourable mind, nor regard our years in what we offer. Sunk in sleep and wine, the Rutulians are silent; we have stealthily spied the open ground that lies in the path through the gate next the sea. The line of fires is broken, and their smoke rises darkly upwards. If you allow us to use the chance towards seeking Aeneas in Pallanteum town, you will soon descry us here at hand with the spoils of the great slaughter we have dealt. Nor shall we miss the way we go; up the dim valleys we have seen the skirts of the town, and learned all the river in continual hunting." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Cetera per terras omnis animalia somno<br>laxabant curas et corda oblita laborum:<br>ductores Teucrum primi, delecta iuuentus,<br>consilium summis regni de rebus habebant,<br>quid facerent quisue Aeneae iam nuntius esset.<br>stant longis adnixi hastis et scuta tenentes<br>castrorum et campi medio. tum Nisus et una<br>Euryalus confestim alacres admittier orant:<br>rem magnam pretiumque morae fore. primus Iulus<br>accepit trepidos ac Nisum dicere iussit.<br>tum sic Hyrtacides: 'audite o mentibus aequis<br>Aeneadae, neue haec nostris spectentur ab annis<br>quae ferimus.

So speaking, he caught both by shoulder and hand, with tears showering down over face and feature. "What guerdon shall I deem may be given you, O men, what recompense for these noble deeds? First and fairest shall be your reward from the gods and your own conduct; and Aeneas the good shall speedily repay the rest, and Ascanius' fresh youth never forget so great a service."—"Nay," breaks in Ascanius, "I whose sole safety is in my father's return, I adjure thee and him, O Nisus, by our great household gods, by the tutelar spirit of Assaracus and hoar Vesta's sanctuary—on your knees I lay all my fortune and trust—recall my father; give him back to sight; all sorrow disappears in his recovery. I will give a pair of cups my father took in vanquished Arisba, wrought in silver and rough with tracery, twin tripods, and two large talents of gold, and an ancient bowl of Sidonian Dido's giving. If it be indeed our lot to possess Italy and grasp a conquering sceptre, and to assign the spoil; thou sawest the horse and armour of Turnus as he went all in gold; that same horse, the shield and the ruddy plume, will I reserve from partition, thy reward, O Nisus, even from now.

But above all thy gifts, one thing I ask of thee. My poor mother of Priam's ancient race, whom neither the Ilian land nor King Acestes' city kept from following me forth, her I now leave in ignorance of this danger, such as it is, and without a farewell, because—night and thine hand be witness!—I cannot bear a parent's tears. But thou, I pray, support her want and relieve her loneliness. Let me take with me this hope in thee, I shall go more daringly to every fortune." Deeply stirred at heart, the Dardanians shed tears, fair Iülus before them all, as the likeness of his own father's love wrung his soul. Then he speaks thus: … "Assure thyself all that is due to thy mighty enterprise; for she shall be a mother to me, and only in name fail to be Creüsa; nor slight is the honour reserved for the mother of such a son. What chance soever follow this deed, I swear by this head whereby my father was wont to swear, what I promise to thee on thy prosperous return shall abide the same for thy mother and kindred." So speaks he weeping, and ungirds from his shoulder the sword inlaid with gold, fashioned with marvellous skill by Lycaon of Gnosus and fitly set in a sheath of ivory. Mnestheus gives Nisus the shaggy spoils of a lion's hide; faithful Aletes exchanges his helmet. They advance onward in arms, and as they go all the company of captains, young and old, speed them to the gates with vows. Likewise fair Iülus, with a man's thought and a spirit beyond his years, gave many messages to be carried to his father. But the breezes shred all asunder and give them unaccomplished to the clouds. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">contra quem talia fatur<br>Euryalus: 'me nulla dies tam fortibus ausis<br>dissimilem arguerit; tantum fortuna secunda<br>haud aduersa cadat. sed te super omnia dona<br>unum oro: genetrix Priami de gente uetusta<br>est mihi, quam miseram tenuit non Ilia tellus<br>mecum excedentem, non moenia regis Acestae.<br>hanc ego nunc ignaram huius quodcumque pericli<br>inque salutatam linquo (nox et tua testis<br>dextera), quod nequeam lacrimas perferre parentis.<br>at tu, oro, solare inopem et succurre relictae.<br>hanc sine me spem ferre tui, audentior ibo<br>in casus omnis.' percussa mente dedere<br>Dardanidae lacrimas, ante omnis pulcher Iulus,<br>atque animum patriae strinxit pietatis imago.<br>tum sic effatur:<br>'sponde digna tuis ingentibus omnia coeptis.<br>namque erit ista mihi genetrix nomenque Creusae<br>solum defuerit, nec partum gratia talem<br>parua manet. casus factum quicumque sequentur,<br>per caput hoc iuro, per quod pater ante solebat:<br>quae tibi polliceor reduci rebusque secundis,<br>haec eadem matrique tuae generique manebunt.'<br>sic ait inlacrimans; umero simul exuit ensem<br>auratum, mira quem fecerat arte Lycaon<br>Cnosius atque habilem uagina aptarat eburna.<br>dat Niso Mnestheus pellem horrentisque leonis<br>exuuias, galeam fidus permutat Aletes.<br>protinus armati incedunt; quos omnis euntis<br>primorum manus ad portas, iuuenumque senumque,<br>prosequitur uotis. nec non et pulcher Iulus,<br>ante annos animumque gerens curamque uirilem,<br>multa patri mandata dabat portanda; sed aurae<br>omnia discerpunt et nubibus inrita donant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>They issue and cross the trenches, and through the shadow of night seek the fatal camp, themselves first to be the death of many a man. All about they see bodies strewn along the grass in drunken sleep, chariots atilt on the shore, the men lying among their traces and wheels, with their armour by them, and their wine. The son of Hyrtacus began thus: "Euryalus, now for daring hands; all invites them; here lies our way; see thou that none raise a hand from behind against us, and keep far-sighted watch. Here will I deal desolation, and make a broad path for thee to follow." So speaks he and checks his voice; therewith he drives his sword at lordly Rhamnes, who haply on carpets heaped high was drawing the full breath of sleep; a king himself, and King Turnus' best-beloved augur, but not all his augury could avert his doom. Three of his household beside him, lying carelessly among their arms, and the armour-bearer and charioteer of Remus go down before him, caught at the horses' feet. Their drooping necks he severs with the sword, then beheads their lord likewise and leaves the trunk spouting blood; the dark warm gore soaks ground and cushions. Therewithal Lamyrus and Lamus, and beautiful young Serranus, who that night had played long and late, and lay with the conquering god heavy on every limb; happy, had he played out the night, and carried his game to day! Even thus an unfed lion riots through full sheepfolds, for the madness of hunger urges him, and champs and rends the fleecy flock that are dumb with fear, and roars with blood-stained mouth. Nor less is the slaughter of Euryalus; he too rages all aflame; an unnamed multitude go down before his path, and Fadus and Herbesus and Rhoetus and Abaris, unaware; Rhoetus awake and seeing all, but he hid in fear behind a great bowl; right in whose breast, as he rose close by, he plunged the sword all its length, and drew it back heavy with death. He vomits forth the crimson life-blood, and throws up wine mixed with blood in the death agony. The other presses hotly on his stealthy errand, and now bent his way towards Messapus' comrades, where he saw the last flicker of the fires go down, and the horses tethered in order cropping the grass; when Nisus briefly speaks thus, for he saw him carried away by excess of murderous desire; "Let us stop; for unfriendly daylight draws nigh. Vengeance is sated to the full; a path is cut through the enemy." Much they leave behind, men's armour wrought in solid silver, and bowls therewith, and beautiful carpets. Euryalus tears away the decorations of Rhamnes and his sword-belt embossed with gold, a gift which Caedicus, wealthiest of men of old, sends to Remulus of Tibur when plighting friendship far away; he on his death-bed gives them to his grandson for his own; after his death the Rutulians captured them as spoil of war; these he fits on the shoulders valiant in vain, then puts on Messapus' light helmet with its graceful plumes. They issue from the camp and make for safety. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Egressi superant fossas noctisque per umbram<br>castra inimica petunt, multis tamen ante futuri<br>exitio. passim somno uinoque per herbam<br>corpora fusa uident, arrectos litore currus,<br>inter lora rotasque uiros, simul arma iacere,<br>uina simul. prior Hyrtacides sic ore locutus:<br>'Euryale, audendum dextra: nunc ipsa uocat res.<br>hac iter est. tu, ne qua manus se attollere nobis<br>a tergo possit, custodi et consule longe;<br>haec ego uasta dabo et lato te limite ducam.'<br>sic memorat uocemque premit, simul ense superbum<br>Rhamnetem adgreditur, qui forte tapetibus altis<br>exstructus toto proflabat pectore somnum,<br>rex idem et regi Turno gratissimus augur,<br>sed non augurio potuit depellere pestem.<br>tris iuxta famulos temere inter tela iacentis<br>armigerumque Remi premit aurigamque sub ipsis<br>nactus equis ferroque secat pendentia colla.<br>tum caput ipsi aufert domino truncumque relinquit<br>sanguine singultantem; atro tepefacta cruore<br>terra torique madent. nec non Lamyrumque Lamumque<br>et iuuenem Serranum, illa qui plurima nocte<br>luserat, insignis facie, multoque iacebat<br>membra deo uictus—felix, si protinus illum<br>aequasset nocti ludum in lucemque tulisset:<br>impastus ceu plena leo per ouilia turbans<br>(suadet enim uesana fames) manditque trahitque<br>molle pecus mutumque metu, fremit ore cruento.<br>nec minor Euryali caedes; incensus et ipse<br>perfurit ac multam in medio sine nomine plebem,<br>Fadumque Herbesumque subit Rhoetumque Abarimque<br>ignaros; Rhoetum uigilantem et cuncta uidentem,<br>sed magnum metuens se post cratera tegebat.<br>pectore in aduerso totum cui comminus ensem<br>condidit adsurgenti et multa morte recepit.<br>purpuream uomit ille animam et cum sanguine mixta<br>uina refert moriens, hic furto feruidus instat.<br>iamque ad Messapi socios tendebat; ibi ignem<br>deficere extremum et religatos rite uidebat<br>carpere gramen equos, breuiter cum talia Nisus<br>(sensit enim nimia caede atque cupidine ferri)<br>'absistamus' ait, 'nam lux inimica propinquat.<br>poenarum exhaustum satis est, uia facta per hostis.'<br>multa uirum solido argento perfecta relinquunt<br>armaque craterasque simul pulchrosque tapetas.<br>Euryalus phaleras Rhamnetis et aurea bullis<br>cingula, Tiburti Remulo ditissimus olim<br>quae mittit dona, hospitio cum iungeret absens,<br>Caedicus; ille suo moriens dat habere nepoti;<br>post mortem bello Rutuli pugnaque potiti:<br>haec rapit atque umeris nequiquam fortibus aptat.<br>tum galeam Messapi habilem cristisque decoram<br>induit. excedunt castris et tuta capessunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile an advanced guard of cavalry were on their way from the Latin city, while the rest of their marshalled battalions linger on the plains, and bore a reply to King Turnus; three hundred men all under shield, in Volscens' leading. And now they approached the camp and drew near the wall, when they descry the two turning away by the pathway to the left; and in the glimmering darkness of night the forgotten helmet betrayed Euryalus, glittering as it met the light. It seemed no thing of chance. Volscens cries aloud from his column: "Stand, men! why on the march, or how are you in arms? or whither hold you your way?" They offer nothing in reply, but quicken their flight into the forest, and throw themselves on the night. On this side and that the horsemen bar the familiar crossways, and encircle every outlet with sentinels. The forest spread wide in tangled thickets and dark ilex; thick growth of briars choked it all about, and the muffled pathway glimmered in a broken track. Hampered by the shadowy boughs and his cumbrous spoil, Euryalus in his fright misses the line of way. Nisus gets clear; and now unthinkingly he had passed the enemy, and the place afterwards called Albani from Alba's name; then the deep coverts were of King Latinus' domain; when he stopped, and looked back in vain for his lost friend. "Euryalus, unhappy! on what ground have I left thee? or where shall I follow, again unwinding all the entanglement of the treacherous woodland way?" Therewith he marks and retraces his footsteps, and wanders down the silent thickets. He hears the horses, hears the clatter and signal-notes of the pursuers. Nor had he long to wait, when shouts reach his ears, and he sees Euryalus, whom even now, in the perplexity of ground and darkness, the whole squadron have borne down in a sudden rush, and seize in spite of all his vain struggles. What shall he do? with what force, what arms dare his rescue? or shall he rush on his doom amid their swords, and find in their wounds a speedy and glorious death? Quickly he draws back his arm with poised spear, and looking up to the moon on high, utters this prayer: "Do thou give present aid to our enterprise, O Latonian goddess, glory of the stars and guardian of the woodlands: by all the gifts my father Hyrtacus ever bore for my sake to thine altars, by all mine own hand hath added from my hunting, or hung in thy dome, or fixed on thy holy roof, grant me to confound these masses, and guide my javelin through the air." He ended, and with all the force of his body hurls the steel. The flying spear whistles through the darkness of the night, and comes full on the shield of Sulmo, and there snaps, and the broken shaft passes on through his heart. Spouting a warm tide from his breast he rolls over chill in death, and his sides throb with long-drawn gasps. Hither and thither they gaze round. Lo, he all the fiercer was poising another weapon high by his ear; while they hesitate, the spear went whizzing through both Tagus' temples, and pierced and stuck fast in the warm brain. Volscens is mad with rage, and nowhere espies the sender of the weapon, nor where to direct his fury. "Yet meanwhile thy warm blood shalt pay me vengeance for both," he cries; and unsheathing his sword, he made at Euryalus. Then indeed frantic with terror Nisus shrieks out; no longer could he shroud himself in darkness or endure such agony. "On me, on me, I am here, I did it, on me turn your steel, O Rutulians! Mine is all the guilt; he dared not, no, nor could not; to this heaven I appeal and the stars that know; he only loved his hapless friend too well." Such words he was uttering; but the sword driven hard home is gone clean through his ribs and pierces the white breast. Euryalus rolls over in death, and the blood runs over his lovely limbs, and his neck sinks and settles on his shoulder; even as when a lustrous flower cut away by the plough droops in death, or weary-necked poppies bow down their head if overweighted with a random shower. But Nisus rushes amidst them, and alone among them all makes at Volscens, keeps to Volscens alone: round him the foe cluster, and on this side and that hurl him back: none the less he presses on, and whirls his sword like lightning, till he plunges it full in the face of the shrieking Rutulian, and slays his enemy as he dies. Then, stabbed through and through, he flung himself above his lifeless friend, and there at last found the quiet sleep of death. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea praemissi equites ex urbe Latina,<br>cetera dum legio campis instructa moratur,<br>ibant et Turno regi responsa ferebant,<br>ter centum, scutati omnes, Volcente magistro.<br>iamque propinquabant castris murosque subibant<br>cum procul hos laeuo flectentis limite cernunt,<br>et galea Euryalum sublustri noctis in umbra<br>prodidit immemorem radiisque aduersa refulsit.<br>haud temere est uisum. conclamat ab agmine Volcens:<br>'state, uiri. quae causa uiae? quiue estis in armis?<br>quoue tenetis iter?' nihil illi tendere contra,<br>sed celerare fugam in siluas et fidere nocti.<br>obiciunt equites sese ad diuortia nota<br>hinc atque hinc, omnemque aditum custode coronant.<br>silua fuit late dumis atque ilice nigra<br>horrida, quam densi complerant undique sentes;<br>rara per occultos lucebat semita callis.<br>Euryalum tenebrae ramorum onerosaque praeda<br>impediunt, fallitque timor regione uiarum.<br>Nisus abit; iamque imprudens euaserat hostis<br>atque locos qui post Albae de nomine dicti<br>Albani (tum rex stabula alta Latinus habebat),<br>ut stetit et frustra absentem respexit amicum:<br>'Euryale infelix, qua te regione reliqui?<br>quaue sequar?' rursus perplexum iter omne reuoluens<br>fallacis siluae simul et uestigia retro<br>obseruata legit dumisque silentibus errat.<br>audit equos, audit strepitus et signa sequentum;<br>nec longum in medio tempus, cum clamor ad auris<br>peruenit ac uidet Euryalum, quem iam manus omnis<br>fraude loci et noctis, subito turbante tumultu,<br>oppressum rapit et conantem plurima frustra.<br>quid faciat? qua ui iuuenem, quibus audeat armis<br>eripere? an sese medios moriturus in enses<br>inferat et pulchram properet per uulnera mortem?<br>ocius adducto torquet hastile lacerto<br>suspiciens altam Lunam et sic uoce precatur:<br>'tu, dea, tu praesens nostro succurre labori,<br>astrorum decus et nemorum Latonia custos.<br>si qua tuis umquam pro me pater Hyrtacus aris<br>dona tulit, si qua ipse meis uenatibus auxi<br>suspendiue tholo aut sacra ad fastigia fixi,<br>hunc sine me turbare globum et rege tela per auras.'<br>dixerat et toto conixus corpore ferrum<br>conicit. hasta uolans noctis diuerberat umbras<br>et uenit auersi in tergum Sulmonis ibique<br>frangitur, ac fisso transit praecordia ligno.<br>uoluitur ille uomens calidum de pectore flumen<br>frigidus et longis singultibus ilia pulsat.<br>diuersi circumspiciunt. hoc acrior idem<br>ecce aliud summa telum librabat ab aure.<br>dum trepidant, it hasta Tago per tempus utrumque<br>stridens traiectoque haesit tepefacta cerebro.<br>saeuit atrox Volcens nec teli conspicit usquam<br>auctorem nec quo se ardens immittere possit.<br>'tu tamen interea calido mihi sanguine poenas<br>persolues amborum' inquit; simul ense recluso<br>ibat in Euryalum. tum uero exterritus, amens,<br>conclamat Nisus nec se celare tenebris<br>amplius aut tantum potuit perferre dolorem:<br>'me, me, adsum qui feci, in me conuertite ferrum,<br>o Rutuli! mea fraus omnis, nihil iste nec ausus<br>nec potuit; caelum hoc et conscia sidera testor;<br>tantum infelicem nimium dilexit amicum.'<br>talia dicta dabat, sed uiribus ensis adactus<br>transadigit costas et candida pectora rumpit.<br>uoluitur Euryalus leto, pulchrosque per artus<br>it cruor inque umeros ceruix conlapsa recumbit:<br>purpureus ueluti cum flos succisus aratro<br>languescit moriens, lassoue papauera collo<br>demisere caput pluuia cum forte grauantur.<br>at Nisus ruit in medios solumque per omnis<br>Volcentem petit, in solo Volcente moratur.<br>quem circum glomerati hostes hinc comminus atque hinc<br>proturbant. instat non setius ac rotat ensem<br>fulmineum, donec Rutuli clamantis in ore<br>condidit aduerso et moriens animam abstulit hosti.<br>tum super exanimum sese proiecit amicum<br>confossus, placidaque ibi demum morte quieuit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Happy pair! if my verse is aught of avail, no length of days shall ever blot you from the memory of time, while the house of Aeneas shall dwell by the Capitoline's stedfast stone, and the lord of Rome hold sovereignty. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Fortunati ambo! si quid mea carmina possunt,<br>nulla dies umquam memori uos eximet aeuo,<br>dum domus Aeneae Capitoli immobile saxum<br>accolet imperiumque pater Romanus habebit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The victorious Rutulians, with their spoils and the plunder regained, bore dead Volscens weeping to the camp.

But instantly the warmth leaves her woeful body, the shuttle starts from her hand and the threads unroll. She darts forth in agony, and with woman's wailing and torn hair runs distractedly towards the walls and the foremost columns, recking naught of men, naught of peril or weapons; thereon she fills the air with her complaint: "Is it thus I behold thee, O Euryalus? Couldst thou, the latest solace of mine age, leave me alone so cruelly? nor when sent into such danger was one last word of thee allowed thine unhappy mother? Alas, thou liest in a strange land, given for a prey to the dogs and fowls of Latium! nor was I, thy mother, there for chief mourner, to lay thee out or close thine eyes or wash thy wounds, and cover thee with the garment I hastened on for thee whole nights and days, an anxious old woman taking comfort from the loom. Whither shall I follow? or what land now holds thy mangled corpse, thy body torn limb from limb? Is this all of what thou wert that returns to me, O my son? is it this I have followed by land and sea? Strike me through of your pity, on me cast all your weapons, Rutulians; make me the first sacrifice of your steel. Or do thou, mighty lord of heaven, be merciful, and with thine own weapon hurl this hateful life to the nether deep, since in no wise else may I break away from life's cruelty." At this weeping cry their courage falters, and a sigh of sorrow passes all along; their strength is benumbed and broken for battle. Her, while her grief kindled, at Ilioneus' and weeping Iülus' bidding Idaeus and Actor catch up and carry home in their arms. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea pauidam uolitans pennata per urbem<br>nuntia Fama ruit matrisque adlabitur auris<br>Euryali. at subitus miserae calor ossa reliquit,<br>excussi manibus radii reuolutaque pensa.<br>euolat infelix et femineo ululatu<br>scissa comam muros amens atque agmina cursu<br>prima petit, non illa uirum, non illa pericli<br>telorumque memor, caelum dehinc questibus implet:<br>'hunc ego te, Euryale, aspicio? tune ille senectae<br>sera meae requies, potuisti linquere solam,<br>crudelis? nec te sub tanta pericula missum<br>adfari extremum miserae data copia matri?<br>heu, terra ignota canibus data praeda Latinis<br>alitibusque iaces! nec te tua funere mater<br>produxi pressiue oculos aut uulnera laui,<br>ueste tegens tibi quam noctes festina diesque<br>urgebam, et tela curas solabar anilis.<br>quo sequar? aut quae nunc artus auulsaque membra<br>et funus lacerum tellus habet? hoc mihi de te,<br>nate, refers? hoc sum terraque marique secuta?<br>figite me, si qua est pietas, in me omnia tela<br>conicite, o Rutuli, me primam absumite ferro;<br>aut tu, magne pater diuum, miserere, tuoque<br>inuisum hoc detrude caput sub Tartara telo,<br>quando aliter nequeo crudelem abrumpere uitam.'<br>hoc fletu concussi animi, maestusque per omnis<br>it gemitus, torpent infractae ad proelia uires.<br>illam incendentem luctus Idaeus et Actor<br>Ilionei monitu et multum lacrimantis Iuli<br>corripiunt interque manus sub tecta reponunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But the terrible trumpet-note afar rang on the shrill brass; a shout follows, and is echoed from the sky. The Volscians hasten up in even line under their advancing roof of shields, and set to fill up the trenches and tear down the palisades. Some seek entrance by scaling the walls with ladders, where the defenders' battle-line is thin, and light shows through gaps in the ring of men. The Teucrians in return shower weapons of every sort, and push them down with stiff poles, practised by long warfare in their ramparts' defence: and fiercely hurl heavy stones, so be they may break the shielded line; while they, crowded under their shell, lightly bear all the downpour. But now they fail; for where the vast mass presses close, the Teucrians roll a huge block tumbling down that makes a wide gap in the Rutulians and crashes through their armour-plating. Nor do the bold Rutulians care longer to continue the blind fight, but strive to clear the rampart with missiles… Elsewhere in dreadful guise Mezentius brandishes his Etruscan pine and hurls smoking brands; but Messapus, tamer of horses, seed of Neptune, tears away the palisading and calls for ladders to the ramparts. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At tuba terribilem sonitum procul aere canoro<br>increpuit, sequitur clamor caelumque remugit.<br>accelerant acta pariter testudine Volsci<br>et fossas implere parant ac uellere uallum;<br>quaerunt pars aditum et scalis ascendere muros,<br>qua rara est acies interlucetque corona<br>non tam spissa uiris. telorum effundere contra<br>omne genus Teucri ac duris detrudere contis,<br>adsueti longo muros defendere bello.<br>saxa quoque infesto uoluebant pondere, si qua<br>possent tectam aciem perrumpere, cum tamen omnis<br>ferre iuuet subter densa testudine casus.<br>nec iam sufficiunt. nam qua globus imminet ingens,<br>immanem Teucri molem uoluuntque ruuntque,<br>quae strauit Rutulos late armorumque resoluit<br>tegmina. nec curant caeco contendere Marte<br>amplius audaces Rutuli, sed pellere uallo<br>missilibus certant.<br>parte alia horrendus uisu quassabat Etruscam<br>pinum et fumiferos infert Mezentius ignis;<br>at Messapus equum domitor, Neptunia proles,<br>rescindit uallum et scalas in moenia poscit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thy sisterhood, O Calliope, I pray inspire me while I sing the destruction spread then and there by Turnus' sword, the deaths dealt from his hand, and whom each warrior sent down to the under world; and unroll with me the broad borders of war. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vos, o Calliope, precor, aspirate canenti<br>quas ibi tum ferro strages, quae funera Turnus<br>ediderit, quem quisque uirum demiserit Orco,<br>et mecum ingentis oras euoluite belli.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>A tower loomed vast with lofty gangways at a point of vantage; this all the Italians strove with main strength to storm, and set all their might and device to overthrow it; the Trojans in return defended it with stones and hurled showers of darts through the loopholes.

Those within, in hurry and confusion, desire retreat from their distress; in vain; while they cluster together and fall back to the side free from the destroyer, the tower sinks prone under the sudden weight with a crash that thunders through all the sky. Pierced by their own weapons, and impaled on hard splinters of wood, they come half slain to the ground with the vast mass behind them. Scarcely do Helenor alone and Lycus struggle out; Helenor in his early prime, whom a slave woman of Licymnos bore in secret to the Maeonian king, and sent to Troy in forbidden weapons, lightly armed with sheathless sword and white unemblazoned shield. And he, when he saw himself among Turnus' encircling thousands, ranks on this side and ranks on this of Latins, as a wild beast which, girt with a crowded ring of hunters, dashes at their weapons, hurls herself unblinded on death, and comes with a bound upon the spears; even so he rushes to his death amid the enemy, and presses on where he sees their weapons thickest. But Lycus, far fleeter of foot, holds by the walls in flight midway among foes and arms, and strives to catch the coping in his grasp and reach the hands of his comrades. And Turnus pursuing and aiming as he ran, thus upbraids him in triumph: "Didst thou hope, madman, thou mightest escape our hands?" and catches him as he clings, and tears him and a great piece of the wall away: as when, with a hare or snowy-bodied swan in his crooked talons, Jove's armour-bearer soars aloft, or the wolf of Mars snatches from the folds some lamb sought of his mother with incessant bleating. On all sides a shout goes up. They advance and fill the trenches with heaps of earth; some toss glowing brands on the roofs. Ilioneus strikes down Lucetius with a great fragment of mountain rock as, carrying fire, he draws nigh the gate. Liger slays Emathion, Asylas Corinaeus, the one skilled with the javelin, the other with the stealthy arrow from afar. Caeneus slays Ortygius; Turnus victorious Caeneus; Turnus Itys and Clonius, Dioxippus, and Promolus, and Sagaris, and Idas where he stood in front of the turret top; Capys Privernus: him Themillas' spear had first grazed lightly; the madman threw down his shield to carry his hand to the wound; so the arrow winged her way, and pinning his hand to his left side, broke into the lungs with deadly wound. The son of Arcens stood splendid in arms, and scarf embroidered with needlework and bright with Iberian blue, the beautiful boy sent by his father Arcens from nurture in the grove of our Lady about the streams of Symaethus, where Palicus' altar is rich and gracious. Laying down his spear, Mezentius whirled thrice round his head the tightened cord of his whistling sling, pierced him full between the temples with the molten bullet, and stretched him all his length upon the sand. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Turris erat uasto suspectu et pontibus altis,<br>opportuna loco, summis quam uiribus omnes<br>expugnare Itali summaque euertere opum ui<br>certabant, Troes contra defendere saxis<br>perque cauas densi tela intorquere fenestras.<br>princeps ardentem coniecit lampada Turnus<br>et flammam adfixit lateri, quae plurima uento<br>corripuit tabulas et postibus haesit adesis.<br>turbati trepidare intus frustraque malorum<br>uelle fugam. dum se glomerant retroque residunt<br>in partem quae peste caret, tum pondere turris<br>procubuit subito et caelum tonat omne fragore.<br>semineces ad terram immani mole secuta<br>confixique suis telis et pectora duro<br>transfossi ligno ueniunt. uix unus Helenor<br>et Lycus elapsi; quorum primaeuus Helenor,<br>Maeonio regi quem serua Licymnia furtim<br>sustulerat uetitisque ad Troiam miserat armis,<br>ense leuis nudo parmaque inglorius alba.<br>isque ubi se Turni media inter milia uidit,<br>hinc acies atque hinc acies astare Latinas,<br>ut fera, quae densa uenantum saepta corona<br>contra tela furit seseque haud nescia morti<br>inicit et saltu supra uenabula fertur—<br>haud aliter iuuenis medios moriturus in hostis<br>inruit et qua tela uidet densissima tendit.<br>at pedibus longe melior Lycus inter et hostis<br>inter et arma fuga muros tenet, altaque certat<br>prendere tecta manu sociumque attingere dextras.<br>quem Turnus pariter cursu teloque secutus<br>increpat his uictor: 'nostrasne euadere, demens,<br>sperasti te posse manus?' simul arripit ipsum<br>pendentem et magna muri cum parte reuellit:<br>qualis ubi aut leporem aut candenti corpore cycnum<br>sustulit alta petens pedibus Iouis armiger uncis,<br>quaesitum aut matri multis balatibus agnum<br>Martius a stabulis rapuit lupus. undique clamor<br>tollitur: inuadunt et fossas aggere complent,<br>ardentis taedas alii ad fastigia iactant.<br>Ilioneus saxo atque ingenti fragmine montis<br>Lucetium portae subeuntem ignisque ferentem,<br>Emathiona Liger, Corynaeum sternit Asilas,<br>hic iaculo bonus, hic longe fallente sagitta,<br>Ortygium Caeneus, uictorem Caenea Turnus,<br>Turnus Ityn Cloniumque, Dioxippum Promolumque<br>et Sagarim et summis stantem pro turribus Idan,<br>Priuernum Capys. hunc primo leuis hasta Themillae<br>strinxerat, ille manum proiecto tegmine demens<br>ad uulnus tulit; ergo alis adlapsa sagitta<br>et laeuo infixa est alte lateri, abditaque intus<br>spiramenta animae letali uulnere rupit.<br>stabat in egregiis Arcentis filius armis<br>pictus acu chlamydem et ferrugine clarus Hibera,<br>insignis facie, genitor quem miserat Arcens<br>eductum Martis luco Symaethia circum<br>flumina, pinguis ubi et placabilis ara Palici:<br>stridentem fundam positis Mezentius hastis<br>ipse ter adducta circum caput egit habena<br>et media aduersi liquefacto tempora plumbo<br>diffidit ac multa porrectum extendit harena.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then, it is said, Ascanius first aimed his flying shaft in war, wont before to frighten beasts of the chase, and struck down a brave Numanian, Remulus by name, but lately allied in bridal to Turnus' younger sister.

A race of hardy breed, we carry our newborn children to the streams and harden them in the bitter icy water; as boys they spend wakeful nights over the chase, and tire out the woodland; but in manhood, unwearied by toil and trained to poverty, they subdue the soil with their mattocks, or shake towns in war.

My hands shall bear yearly gifts to thee in thy temple, and bring to stand before thine altars a steer with gilded forehead, snow-white, carrying his head high as his mother's, already pushing with his horn and making the sand fly up under his feet." The Father heard and from a clear space of sky thundered on the left; at once the fated bow rings, the grim-whistling arrow flies from the tense string, and goes through the head of Remulus, the steel piercing through from temple to temple. "Go, mock valour with insolence of speech! Phrygians twice taken return this answer to Rutulians." Thus and no further Ascanius; the Teucrians respond in cheers, and shout for joy in rising height of courage. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia iactantem dictis ac dira canentem<br>non tulit Ascanius, neruoque obuersus equino<br>contendit telum diuersaque bracchia ducens<br>constitit, ante Iouem supplex per uota precatus:<br>'Iuppiter omnipotens, audacibus adnue coeptis.<br>ipse tibi ad tua templa feram sollemnia dona,<br>et statuam ante aras aurata fronte iuuencum<br>candentem pariterque caput cum matre ferentem,<br>iam cornu petat et pedibus qui spargat harenam.'<br>audiit et caeli genitor de parte serena<br>intonuit laeuum, sonat una fatifer arcus.<br>effugit horrendum stridens adducta sagitta<br>perque caput Remuli uenit et caua tempora ferro<br>traicit.

Rightly shall all wars fated to come sink to peace beneath the line of Assaracus; nor art thou bounded in a Troy." So speaking, he darts from heaven's height, and cleaving the breezy air, seeks Ascanius. Then he changes the fashion of his countenance, and becomes aged Butes, armour-bearer of old to Dardanian Anchises, and the faithful porter of his threshold; thereafter his lord gave him for Ascanius' attendant. In all points like the old man Apollo came, voice and colour, white hair, and grimly clashing arms, and speaks these words to eager Iülus: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aetheria tum forte plaga crinitus Apollo<br>desuper Ausonias acies urbemque uidebat<br>nube sedens, atque his uictorem adfatur Iulum:<br>'macte noua uirtute, puer, sic itur ad astra,<br>dis genite et geniture deos. iure omnia bella<br>gente sub Assaraci fato uentura resident,<br>nec te Troia capit.' simul haec effatus ab alto<br>aethere se mittit, spirantis dimouet auras<br>Ascaniumque petit; forma tum uertitur oris<br>antiquum in Buten. hic Dardanio Anchisae<br>armiger ante fuit fidusque ad limina custos;<br>tum comitem Ascanio pater addidit. ibat Apollo<br>omnia longaeuo similis uocemque coloremque<br>et crinis albos et saeua sonoribus arma,<br>atque his ardentem dictis adfatur Iulum:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Be it enough, son of Aeneas, that the Numanian hath fallen unavenged beneath thine arrows; this first honour great Apollo allows thee, nor envies the arms that match his own. Further, O boy, let war alone." Thus Apollo began, and yet speaking retreated from mortal view, vanishing into thin air away out of their eyes. The Dardanian princes knew the god and the arms of deity, and heard the clash of his quiver as he went. So they restrain Ascanius' keenness for battle by the words of Phoebus' will; themselves they again close in conflict, and cast their lives into the perilous breach. Shouts run all along the battlemented walls; ringing bows are drawn and javelin thongs twisted: all the ground is strewn with missiles. Shields and hollow helmets ring to blows; the battle swells fierce; heavy as the shower lashes the ground that sets in when the Kids are rainy in the West; thick as hail pours down from storm-clouds on the shallows, when the rough lord of the winds congeals his watery deluge and breaks up the hollow vapours in the sky. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'sit satis, Aenide, telis impune Numanum<br>oppetiisse tuis. primam hanc tibi magnus Apollo<br>concedit laudem et paribus non inuidet armis;<br>cetera parce, puer, bello.' sic orsus Apollo<br>mortalis medio aspectus sermone reliquit<br>et procul in tenuem ex oculis euanuit auram.<br>agnouere deum proceres diuinaque tela<br>Dardanidae pharetramque fuga sensere sonantem.<br>ergo auidum pugnae dictis ac numine Phoebi<br>Ascanium prohibent, ipsi in certamina rursus<br>succedunt animasque in aperta pericula mittunt.<br>it clamor totis per propugnacula muris,<br>intendunt acris arcus amentaque torquent.<br>sternitur omne solum telis, tum scuta cauaeque<br>dant sonitum flictu galeae, pugna aspera surgit:<br>quantus ab occasu ueniens pluuialibus Haedis<br>uerberat imber humum, quam multa grandine nimbi<br>in uada praecipitant, cum Iuppiter horridus Austris<br>torquet aquosam hiemem et caelo caua nubila rumpit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Pandarus and Bitias, sprung of Alcanor of Ida, whom woodland Iaera bore in the grove of Jupiter, grown now tall as their ancestral pines and hills, fling open the gates barred by their captain's order, and confident in arms, wilfully invite the enemy within the walls. Themselves within they stand to right and left in front of the towers, sheathed in iron, the plumes flickering over their stately heads: even as high in air around the gliding streams, whether on Padus' banks or by pleasant Athesis, twin oaks rise lifting their unshorn heads into the sky with high tops asway. The Rutulians pour in when they see the entrance open. Straightway Quercens and Aquicolus beautiful in arms, and desperate Tmarus, and Haemon, seed of Mars, either gave back in rout with all their columns, or in the very gateway laid down their life. Then the spirits of the combatants swell in rising wrath, and now the Trojans gather swarming to the spot, and dare to close hand to hand and to sally farther out. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Pandarus et Bitias, Idaeo Alcanore creti,<br>quos Iouis eduxit luco siluestris Iaera<br>abietibus iuuenes patriis et montibus aequos,<br>portam, quae ducis imperio commissa, recludunt<br>freti armis, ultroque inuitant moenibus hostem.<br>ipsi intus dextra ac laeua pro turribus astant<br>armati ferro et cristis capita alta corusci:<br>quales aeriae liquentia flumina circum<br>siue Padi ripis Athesim seu propter amoenum<br>consurgunt geminae quercus intonsaque caelo<br>attollunt capita et sublimi uertice nutant.<br>inrumpunt aditus Rutuli ut uidere patentis:<br>continuo Quercens et pulcher Aquiculus armis<br>et praeceps animi Tmarus et Mauortius Haemon<br>agminibus totis aut uersi terga dedere<br>aut ipso portae posuere in limine uitam.<br>tum magis increscunt animis discordibus irae,<br>et iam collecti Troes glomerantur eodem<br>et conferre manum et procurrere longius audent.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>News is brought to Turnus the captain, as he rages afar among the routed foe, that the enemy surges forth into fresh slaughter and flings wide his gates. He breaks off unfinished, and, fired with immense anger, rushes towards the haughty brethren at the Dardanian gate. And on Antiphates first, for first he came, the bastard son of mighty Sarpedon by a Theban mother, he hurls his javelin and strikes him down; the Italian cornel flies through the yielding air, and, piercing the gullet, runs deep into his breast; a frothing tide pours from the dark yawning wound, and the steel grows warm where it pierces the lung. Then Meropes and Erymas, then Aphidnus goes down before his hand; then Bitias, fiery-eyed and exultant, not with a javelin; for not to a javelin had he given his life; but the loud-whistling pike came hurled with a thunderbolt's force; neither twofold bull's hide kept it back, nor the trusty corslet's double scales of gold: his vast limbs sink in a heap; earth utters a groan, and the great shield clashes over him: even as once and again on the Euboïc shore of Baiae falls a mass of stone, built up of great blocks and so cast into the sea; thus does it tumble prone, crashes into the shoal water and sinks deep to rest; the seas are stirred, and the dark sand eddies up; therewith the depth of Prochyta quivers at the sound, and the couchant rocks of Inarime, piled above Typhoeus by Jove's commands. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ductori Turno diuersa in parte furenti<br>turbantique uiros perfertur nuntius, hostem<br>feruere caede noua et portas praebere patentis.<br>deserit inceptum atque immani concitus ira<br>Dardaniam ruit ad portam fratresque superbos.<br>et primum Antiphaten (is enim se primus agebat),<br>Thebana de matre nothum Sarpedonis alti,<br>coniecto sternit iaculo: uolat Itala cornus<br>aera per tenerum stomachoque infixa sub altum<br>pectus abit; reddit specus atri uulneris undam<br>spumantem, et fixo ferrum in pulmone tepescit.<br>tum Meropem atque Erymanta manu, tum sternit Aphidnum,<br>tum Bitian ardentem oculis animisque frementem,<br>non iaculo (neque enim iaculo uitam ille dedisset),<br>sed magnum stridens contorta phalarica uenit<br>fulminis acta modo, quam nec duo taurea terga<br>nec duplici squama lorica fidelis et auro<br>sustinuit; conlapsa ruunt immania membra,<br>dat tellus gemitum et clipeum super intonat ingens.<br>talis in Euboico Baiarum litore quondam<br>saxea pila cadit, magnis quam molibus ante<br>constructam ponto iaciunt, sic illa ruinam<br>prona trahit penitusque uadis inlisa recumbit;<br>miscent se maria et nigrae attolluntur harenae,<br>tum sonitu Prochyta alta tremit durumque cubile<br>Inarime Iouis imperiis imposta Typhoeo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>On this Mars armipotent raised the spirit and strength of the Latins, and goaded their hearts to rage, and sent Flight and dark Fear among the Teucrians. From all quarters they gather, since battle is freely offered; and the warrior god inspires… Pandarus, at his brother's fall, sees how fortune stands, what hap rules the day; and swinging the gate round on its hinge with all his force, pushes it to with his broad shoulders, leaving many of his own people shut outside the walls in the desperate conflict, but shutting others in with him as they pour back in retreat. Madman! who saw not the Rutulian prince burst in amid their columns, and fairly shut him into the town, like a monstrous tiger among the silly flocks. At once strange light flashed from his eyes, and his armour rang terribly; the blood-red plumes flicker on his head, and lightnings shoot sparkling from his shield. In sudden dismay the Aeneadae know the hated form and giant limbs. Then tall Pandarus leaps forward, in burning rage at his brother's death: "This is not the palace of Amata's dower," he cries, "nor does Ardea enclose Turnus in her native walls. Thou seest a hostile camp; escape hence is hopeless." To him Turnus, smiling and cool: "Begin with all thy valiance, and close hand to hand; here too shalt thou tell that a Priam found his Achilles." He ended; the other, putting out all his strength, hurls his rough spear, knotty and unpeeled. The breezes caught it; Juno, daughter of Saturn, made the wound glance off as it came, and the spear sticks fast in the gate. "But this weapon that my strong hand whirls, this thou shalt not escape; for not such is he who sends weapon and wound." So speaks he, and rises high on his uplifted sword; the steel severs the forehead midway right between the temples, and divides the beardless cheeks with ghastly wound. He crashes down; earth shakes under the vast weight; dying limbs and brain-spattered armour tumble in a heap to the ground, and the head, evenly severed, dangles this way and that from either shoulder. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic Mars armipotens animum uirisque Latinis<br>addidit et stimulos acris sub pectore uertit,<br>immisitque Fugam Teucris atrumque Timorem.<br>undique conueniunt, quoniam data copia pugnae,<br>bellatorque animo deus incidit.<br>Pandarus, ut fuso germanum corpore cernit<br>et quo sit fortuna loco, qui casus agat res,<br>portam ui multa conuerso cardine torquet<br>obnixus latis umeris, multosque suorum<br>moenibus exclusos duro in certamine linquit;<br>ast alios secum includit recipitque ruentis,<br>demens, qui Rutulum in medio non agmine regem<br>uiderit inrumpentem ultroque incluserit urbi,<br>immanem ueluti pecora inter inertia tigrim.<br>continuo noua lux oculis effulsit et arma<br>horrendum sonuere, tremunt in uertice cristae<br>sanguineae clipeoque micantia fulmina mittit.<br>agnoscunt faciem inuisam atque immania membra<br>turbati subito Aeneadae. tum Pandarus ingens<br>emicat et mortis fraternae feruidus ira<br>effatur: 'non haec dotalis regia Amatae,<br>nec muris cohibet patriis media Ardea Turnum.<br>castra inimica uides, nulla hinc exire potestas.'<br>olli subridens sedato pectore Turnus:<br>'incipe, si qua animo uirtus, et consere dextram,<br>hic etiam inuentum Priamo narrabis Achillem.'<br>dixerat. ille rudem nodis et cortice crudo<br>intorquet summis adnixus uiribus hastam;<br>excepere aurae, uulnus Saturnia Iuno<br>detorsit ueniens, portaeque infigitur hasta.<br>'at non hoc telum, mea quod ui dextera uersat,<br>effugies, neque enim is teli nec uulneris auctor':<br>sic ait, et sublatum alte consurgit in ensem<br>et mediam ferro gemina inter tempora frontem<br>diuidit impubisque immani uulnere malas.<br>fit sonus, ingenti concussa est pondere tellus;<br>conlapsos artus atque arma cruenta cerebro<br>sternit humi moriens, atque illi partibus aequis<br>huc caput atque illuc umero ex utroque pependit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The Trojans scatter and turn in hasty terror; and had the conqueror forthwith taken thought to burst the bars and let in his comrades at the gate, that had been the last day of the war and of the nation.

Little by little Turnus drew away from the fight towards the river, and the side encircled by the stream: the more bravely the Teucrians press on him with loud shouts and thickening masses, even as a band that fall on a wrathful lion with levelled weapons, but he, frightened back, retires surly and grim-glaring; and neither does wrath nor courage let him turn his back, nor can he make head, for all that he desires it, against the surrounding arms and men. Even thus Turnus draws lingeringly backward, with unhastened steps, and soul boiling in anger. Nay, twice even then did he charge amid the enemy, twice drove them in flying rout along the walls. But all the force of the camp gathers hastily up; nor does Juno, daughter of Saturn, dare to supply him strength to countervail; for Jupiter sent Iris down through the aery sky, bearing stern orders to his sister that Turnus shall withdraw from the high Trojan town. Therefore neither with shield nor hand can he keep his ground, so overpoweringly from all sides comes upon him the storm of weapons. About the hollows of his temples the helmet rings with incessant clash, and the solid brass is riven beneath the stones; the horsehair crest is rent away; the shield-boss avails not under the blows; Mnestheus thunders on with his Trojans, and pours in a storm of spears. All over him the sweat trickles and pours in swart stream, and no breathing space is given; sick gasps shake his exhausted limbs. Then at last, with a headlong bound, he leapt fully armed into the river; the river's yellow eddies opened for him as he came, and the buoyant water brought him up, and, washing away the slaughter, returned him triumphant to his comrades. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">talibus accensi firmantur et agmine denso<br>consistunt.
