They sit down within from doorway to doorway: their lord begins: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Panditur interea domus omnipotentis Olympi<br>conciliumque uocat diuum pater atque hominum rex<br>sideream in sedem, terras unde arduus omnis<br>castraque Dardanidum aspectat populosque Latinos.<br>considunt tectis bipatentibus, incipit ipse:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Lords of heaven, wherefore is your decree turned back, and your minds thus jealously at strife? I forbade Italy to join battle with the Teucrians; why this quarrel in face of my injunction? What terror hath bidden one or another run after arms and tempt the sword? The due time of battle will arrive, call it not forth, when furious Carthage shall one day sunder the Alps to hurl ruin full on the towers of Rome. Then hatred may grapple with hatred, then hostilities be opened; now let them be, and cheerfully join in the treaty we ordain." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'caelicolae magni, quianam sententia uobis<br>uersa retro tantumque animis certatis iniquis?<br>abnueram bello Italiam concurrere Teucris.<br>quae contra uetitum discordia? quis metus aut hos<br>aut hos arma sequi ferrumque lacessere suasit?<br>adueniet iustum pugnae (ne arcessite) tempus,<br>cum fera Karthago Romanis arcibus olim<br>exitium magnum atque Alpis immittet apertas:<br>tum certare odiis, tum res rapuisse licebit.<br>nunc sinite et placitum laeti componite foedus.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus Jupiter in brief; but not briefly golden Venus returns in answer: … <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iuppiter haec paucis; at non Venus aurea contra<br>pauca refert:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"O Lord, O everlasting Governor of men and things—for what else may we yet supplicate?—beholdest thou how the Rutulians brave it, and Turnus, borne charioted through the ranks, proudly sweeps down the tide of battle? Bar and bulwark no longer shelter the Trojans; nay, within the gates and even on the mounded walls they clash in battle and make the trenches swim with blood. Aeneas is away and ignorant. Wilt thou never then let our leaguer be raised? Again a foe overhangs the walls of infant Troy; and another army, and a second son of Tydeus rises from Aetolian Arpi against the Trojans. Truly I think my wounds are yet to come, and I thy child am keeping some mortal weapons idle. If the Trojans steered for Italy without thy leave and defiant of thy deity, let them expiate their sin; aid not such with thy succour. But if so many oracles guided them, given by god and ghost, why may aught now reverse thine ordinance or write destiny anew? Why should I recall the fleets burned on the coast of Eryx? why the king of storms, and the raging winds roused from Aeolia, or Iris driven down the clouds? Now hell too is stirred (this share of the world was yet untried) and Allecto suddenly let loose above to riot through the Italian towns. In no wise am I moved for empire; that was our hope while Fortune stood; let those conquer whom thou wilt. If thy cruel wife leave no region free to Teucrians, by the smoking ruins of desolated Troy, O father, I beseech thee, grant Ascanius unhurt retreat from arms, grant me my child's life. Aeneas may well be tossed over unknown seas and follow what path soever fortune open to him; him let me avail to shelter and withdraw from the turmoil of battle. Amathus is mine, high Paphos and Cythera, and my house of Idalia; here, far from arms, let him spend an inglorious life. Bid Carthage in high lordship rule Ausonia; there will be nothing there to check the Tyrian cities. What help was it for the Trojans to escape war's doom and thread their flight through Argive fires, to have exhausted all those perils of sea and desolate lands, while they seek Latium and the towers of a Troy rebuilt? Were it not better to have clung to the last ashes of their country, and the ground where once was Troy? Give back, I pray, Xanthus and Simoïs to a wretched people, and let the Teucrians again, O Lord, circle through the fates of Ilium." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'o pater, o hominum rerumque aeterna potestas<br>(namque aliud quid sit quod iam implorare queamus?),<br>cernis ut insultent Rutuli, Turnusque feratur<br>per medios insignis equis tumidusque secundo<br>Marte ruat? non clausa tegunt iam moenia Teucros;<br>quin intra portas atque ipsis proelia miscent<br>aggeribus murorum et inundant sanguine fossae.<br>Aeneas ignarus abest. numquamne leuari<br>obsidione sines? muris iterum imminet hostis<br>nascentis Troiae nec non exercitus alter,<br>atque iterum in Teucros Aetolis surgit ab Arpis<br>Tydides. equidem credo, mea uulnera restant<br>et tua progenies mortalia demoror arma.<br>si sine pace tua atque inuito numine Troes<br>Italiam petiere, luant peccata neque illos<br>iuueris auxilio; sin tot responsa secuti<br>quae superi manesque dabant, cur nunc tua quisquam<br>uertere iussa potest aut cur noua condere fata?<br>quid repetam exustas Erycino in litore classis,<br>quid tempestatum regem uentosque furentis<br>Aeolia excitos aut actam nubibus Irim?<br>nunc etiam manis (haec intemptata manebat<br>sors rerum) mouet et superis immissa repente<br>Allecto medias Italum bacchata per urbes.<br>nil super imperio moueor. sperauimus ista,<br>dum fortuna fuit. uincant, quos uincere mauis.<br>si nulla est regio Teucris quam det tua coniunx<br>dura, per euersae, genitor, fumantia Troiae<br>excidia obtestor: liceat dimittere ab armis<br>incolumem Ascanium, liceat superesse nepotem.<br>Aeneas sane ignotis iactetur in undis<br>et quacumque uiam dederit Fortuna sequatur:<br>hunc tegere et dirae ualeam subducere pugnae.<br>est Amathus, est celsa mihi Paphus atque Cythera<br>Idaliaeque domus: positis inglorius armis<br>exigat hic aeuum. magna dicione iubeto<br>Karthago premat Ausoniam; nihil urbibus inde<br>obstabit Tyriis. quid pestem euadere belli<br>iuuit et Argolicos medium fugisse per ignis<br>totque maris uastaeque exhausta pericula terrae,<br>dum Latium Teucri recidiuaque Pergama quaerunt?<br>non satius cineres patriae insedisse supremos<br>atque solum quo Troia fuit?

Hath any man or god constrained Aeneas to court war or make armed attack on King Latinus? In oracular guidance he steered for Italy: be it so: he whom raving Cassandra sent on his way! Did we urge him to quit the camp or entrust his life to the winds? to give the issue of war and the charge of his ramparts to a child? to stir the loyalty of Tyrrhenia or throw peaceful nations into tumult? What god, what potent cruelty of ours, hath driven him on his hurt? Where is Juno in this, or Iris sped down the clouds? It shocks thee that Italians should enring an infant Troy with flame, and Turnus set foot on his own ancestral soil—he, grandchild of Pilumnus, son of Venilia the goddess: how, that the dark brands of Troy assail the Latins? that Trojans subjugate and plunder fields not their own? how, that they choose their brides and tear plighted bosom from bosom? that their gestures plead for peace, and their ships are lined with arms? Thou canst steal thine Aeneas from Grecian hands, and spread before them a human semblance of mist and empty air; thou canst turn his fleet into nymphs of like number: is it dreadful if we retaliate with any aid to the Rutulians? Aeneas is away and ignorant; away and ignorant let him be. Paphos is thine and Idalium, thine high Cythera; why meddlest thou with fierce spirits and a city big with war? Is it we who would overthrow the tottering state of Phrygia? we? or he who brought the Achaeans down on the hapless Trojans? who made Europe and Asia bristle up in arms, and whose theft shattered the alliance? Was it in my guidance the adulterous Dardanian broke into Sparta? or did I send the shafts of passion that kindled war? Then terror for thy children had graced thee; too late now dost thou rise with unjust complaints, and reproaches leave thy lips in vain." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'quid me alta silentia cogis<br>rumpere et obductum uerbis uulgare dolorem?<br>Aenean hominum quisquam diuumque subegit<br>bella sequi aut hostem regi se inferre Latino?<br>Italiam petiit fatis auctoribus (esto)<br>Cassandrae impulsus furiis: num linquere castra<br>hortati sumus aut uitam committere uentis?<br>num puero summam belli, num credere muros,<br>Tyrrhenamque fidem aut gentis agitare quietas?<br>quis deus in fraudem, quae dura potentia nostra<br>egit? ubi hic Iuno demissaue nubibus Iris?<br>indignum est Italos Troiam circumdare flammis<br>nascentem et patria Turnum consistere terra,<br>cui Pilumnus auus, cui diua Venilia mater:<br>quid face Troianos atra uim ferre Latinis,<br>arua aliena iugo premere atque auertere praedas?<br>quid soceros legere et gremiis abducere pactas,<br>pacem orare manu, praefigere puppibus arma?<br>tu potes Aenean manibus subducere Graium<br>proque uiro nebulam et uentos obtendere inanis,<br>et potes in totidem classem conuertere nymphas:<br>nos aliquid Rutulos contra iuuisse nefandum est?<br>"Aeneas ignarus abest": ignarus et absit.<br>est Paphus Idaliumque tibi, sunt alta Cythera:<br>quid grauidam bellis urbem et corda aspera temptas?<br>nosne tibi fluxas Phrygiae res uertere fundo<br>conamur? nos? an miseros qui Troas Achiuis<br>obiecit? quae causa fuit consurgere in arma<br>Europamque Asiamque et foedera soluere furto?<br>me duce Dardanius Spartam expugnauit adulter,<br>aut ego tela dedi fouiue Cupidine bella?<br>tum decuit metuisse tuis: nunc sera querelis<br>haud iustis adsurgis et inrita iurgia iactas.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus Juno pleaded; and all the heavenly people murmured in diverse consent; even as rising gusts murmur when caught in the forests, and eddy in blind moanings, betraying to sailors the gale's approach.

Nor do I acquit the Rutulians. Each as he hath begun shall work out his destiny. Jupiter is one and king over all; the fates will find their way." By his brother's infernal streams, by the banks of the pitchy black-boiling chasm he signed assent, and made all Olympus quiver at his nod. Here speaking ended: thereon Jupiter rises from his golden throne, and the heavenly people surround and escort him to the doorway. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'accipite ergo animis atque haec mea figite dicta.<br>quandoquidem Ausonios coniungi foedere Teucris<br>haud licitum, nec uestra capit discordia finem,<br>quae cuique est fortuna hodie, quam quisque secat spem,<br>Tros Rutulusne fuat, nullo discrimine habebo,<br>seu fatis Italum castra obsidione tenentur<br>siue errore malo Troiae monitisque sinistris.<br>nec Rutulos soluo. sua cuique exorsa laborem<br>fortunamque ferent. rex Iuppiter omnibus idem.<br>fata uiam inuenient.'

But the army of the Aeneadae are held leaguered within their trenches, with no hope of retreat. They stand helpless and disconsolate on their high towers, and their thin ring girdles the walls,—Asius, son of Imbrasus, and Thymoetes, son of Hicetaon, and the two Assaraci, and Castor, and old Thymbris together in the front rank: by them Clarus and Themon, both full brothers to Sarpedon, out of high Lycia. Acmon of Lyrnesus, great as his father Clytius, or his brother Mnestheus, carries a stone, straining all his vast frame to the huge mountain fragment. Emulously they keep their guard, these with javelins, those with stones, and wield fire and fit arrows on the string. Amid them he, Venus' fittest care, lo! the Dardanian boy, his graceful head uncovered, shines even as a gem set in red gold on ornament of throat or head, or even as gleaming ivory cunningly inlaid in boxwood or Orician terebinth; his tresses lie spread over his milk-white neck, bound by a flexible circlet of gold. Thee, too, Ismarus, proud nations saw aiming wounds and arming thy shafts with poison,—thee, of house illustrious in Maeonia, where the rich tilth is wrought by men's hands, and Pactolus waters it with gold. There too was Mnestheus, exalted in fame as he who erewhile had driven Turnus from the ramparts; and Capys, from whom is drawn the name of the Campanian city. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea Rutuli portis circum omnibus instant<br>sternere caede uiros et moenia cingere flammis.<br>at legio Aeneadum uallis obsessa tenetur<br>nec spes ulla fugae. miseri stant turribus altis<br>nequiquam et rara muros cinxere corona<br>Asius Imbrasides Hicetaoniusque Thymoetes<br>Assaracique duo et senior cum Castore Thymbris,<br>prima acies; hos germani Sarpedonis ambo<br>et Clarus et Thaemon Lycia comitantur ab alta.<br>fert ingens toto conixus corpore saxum,<br>haud partem exiguam montis, Lyrnesius Acmon,<br>nec Clytio genitore minor nec fratre Menestheo.<br>hi iaculis, illi certant defendere saxis<br>molirique ignem neruoque aptare sagittas.<br>ipse inter medios, Veneris iustissima cura,<br>Dardanius caput, ecce, puer detectus honestum,<br>qualis gemma micat fuluum quae diuidit aurum,<br>aut collo decus aut capiti, uel quale per artem<br>inclusum buxo aut Oricia terebintho<br>lucet ebur; fusos ceruix cui lactea crinis<br>accipit et molli subnectens circulus auro.<br>te quoque magnanimae uiderunt, Ismare, gentes<br>uulnera derigere et calamos armare ueneno,<br>Maeonia generose domo, ubi pinguia culta<br>exercentque uiri Pactolusque inrigat auro.<br>adfuit et Mnestheus, quem pulsi pristina Turni<br>aggere murorum sublimem gloria tollit,<br>et Capys: hinc nomen Campanae ducitur urbi.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>They had closed in grim war's mutual conflict; Aeneas, while night was yet deep, clove the seas. For when, leaving Evander for the Etruscan camp, he hath audience of the king, and tells the king of his name and race, and what he asks or offers, instructs him of the arms Mezentius is winning to his side, and of Turnus' overbearing spirit, reminds him what is all the certainty of human things, and mingles all with entreaties; delaying not, Tarchon joins forces and strikes alliance. Then, freed from the oracle, the Lydian people man their fleet, laid by divine ordinance in the foreign captain's hand. Aeneas' galley keeps in front, with the lions of Phrygia fastened on her prow, above them overhanging Ida, sight most welcome to the Trojan exiles. Here great Aeneas sits revolving the changing issues of war; and Pallas, clinging on his left side, asks now of the stars and their pathway through the dark night, now of his fortunes by land and sea. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Illi inter sese duri certamina belli<br>contulerant: media Aeneas freta nocte secabat.<br>namque ut ab Euandro castris ingressus Etruscis<br>regem adit et regi memorat nomenque genusque<br>quidue petat quidue ipse ferat, Mezentius arma<br>quae sibi conciliet, uiolentaque pectora Turni<br>edocet, humanis quae sit fiducia rebus<br>admonet immiscetque preces, haud fit mora, Tarchon<br>iungit opes foedusque ferit; tum libera fati<br>classem conscendit iussis gens Lydia diuum<br>externo commissa duci.

With him goes grim Abas, all his train in shining armour, and a gilded Apollo glittering astern. To him Populonia had given six hundred of her children, tried in war, but Ilva three hundred, the island rich in unexhausted mines of steel. Third Asilas, interpreter between men and gods, master of the entrails of beasts and the stars in heaven, of speech of birds and ominous lightning flashes, draws a thousand men after him in serried lines bristling with spears, bidden to his command from Pisa city, of Alphaean birth on Etruscan soil. Astyr follows, excellent in beauty, Astyr, confident in his horse and glancing arms. Three hundred more—all have one heart to follow—come from the householders of Caere and the fields of Minio, and ancient Pyrgi, and fever-stricken Graviscae. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Massicus aerata princeps secat aequora Tigri,<br>sub quo mille manus iuuenum, qui moenia Clusi<br>quique urbem liquere Cosas, quis tela sagittae<br>gorytique leues umeris et letifer arcus.<br>una toruus Abas: huic totum insignibus armis<br>agmen et aurato fulgebat Apolline puppis.<br>sescentos illi dederat Populonia mater<br>expertos belli iuuenes, ast Ilua trecentos<br>insula inexhaustis Chalybum generosa metallis.<br>tertius ille hominum diuumque interpres Asilas,<br>cui pecudum fibrae, caeli cui sidera parent<br>et linguae uolucrum et praesagi fulminis ignes,<br>mille rapit densos acie atque horrentibus hastis.<br>hos parere iubent Alpheae ab origine Pisae,<br>urbs Etrusca solo. sequitur pulcherrimus Astyr,<br>Astyr equo fidens et uersicoloribus armis.<br>ter centum adiciunt (mens omnibus una sequendi)<br>qui Caerete domo, qui sunt Minionis in aruis,<br>et Pyrgi ueteres intempestaeque Grauiscae.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Let me not pass thee by, O Cinyras, bravest in war of Ligurian captains, and thee, Cupavo, with thy scant company, from whose crest rise the swan plumes, fault, O Love, of thee and thine, and blazonment of his father's form. For they tell that Cycnus, in grief for his beloved Phaëthon, while he sings and soothes his woeful love with music amid the shady sisterhood of poplar boughs, drew over him the soft plumage of white old age, and left earth and passed crying through the sky. His son, followed on shipboard with a band of like age, sweeps the huge Centaur forward with his oars; he leans over the water, and threatens the waves with a vast rock he holds on high, and furrows the deep seas with his length of keel. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Non ego te, Ligurum ductor fortissime bello,<br>transierim, Cunare, et paucis comitate Cupauo,<br>cuius olorinae surgunt de uertice pennae<br>(crimen, Amor, uestrum) formaeque insigne paternae.<br>namque ferunt luctu Cycnum Phaethontis amati,<br>populeas inter frondes umbramque sororum<br>dum canit et maestum Musa solatur amorem,<br>canentem molli pluma duxisse senectam<br>linquentem terras et sidera uoce sequentem.<br>filius aequalis comitatus classe cateruas<br>ingentem remis Centaurum promouet: ille<br>instat aquae saxumque undis immane minatur<br>arduus, et longa sulcat maria alta carina.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>He too calls a train from his native coasts, Ocnus, son of prophetic Manto and the river of Tuscany, who gave thee, O Mantua, ramparts and his mother's name; Mantua, rich in ancestry, yet not all of one blood, a threefold race, and under each race four cantons; herself she is the cantons' head, and her strength is of Tuscan blood. From her likewise hath Mezentius five hundred in arms against him, whom Mincius, child of Benacus, draped in gray reeds, led to battle in his advancing pine. Aulestes moves on heavily, smiting the waves with the swinging forest of an hundred oars; the channels foam as they sweep the sea-floor. He sails in the vast Triton, who amazes the blue waterways with his shell, and swims on with shaggy front, in human show from the flank upward; his belly ends in a dragon; beneath the monster's breast the wave gurgles into foam. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet Ocnus ab oris,<br>fatidicae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis,<br>qui muros matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen,<br>Mantua diues auis, sed non genus omnibus unum:<br>gens illi triplex, populi sub gente quaterni,<br>ipsa caput populis, Tusco de sanguine uires.<br>hinc quoque quingentos in se Mezentius armat,<br>quos patre Benaco uelatus harundine glauca<br>Mincius infesta ducebat in aequora pinu.<br>it grauis Aulestes centenaque arbore fluctum<br>uerberat adsurgens, spumant uada marmore uerso.<br>hunc uehit immanis Triton et caerula concha<br>exterrens freta, cui laterum tenus hispida nanti<br>frons hominem praefert, in pristim desinit aluus,<br>spumea semifero sub pectore murmurat unda.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>So many were the chosen princes who went in thirty ships to aid Troy, and cut the salt plains with brazen prow. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tot lecti proceres ter denis nauibus ibant<br>subsidio Troiae et campos salis aere secabant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now day had faded from the sky, and gracious Phoebe trod mid-heaven in the chariot of her nightly wandering: Aeneas, for his charge allows not rest to his limbs, himself sits guiding the tiller and managing the sails. And lo, in middle course a band of his own fellow-voyagers meets him, the nymphs whom bountiful Cybele had bidden be gods of the sea, and turn to nymphs from ships; they swam on in even order, and cleft the flood, as many as erewhile, brazen-plated prows, had anchored on the beach. From far they know their king, and wheel their bands about him, and Cymodocea, their readiest in speech, comes up behind, catching the stern with her right hand: her back rises out, and her left hand oars her passage through the silent water. Then she thus accosts her amazed lord: "Wakest thou, seed of gods, Aeneas? wake, and loosen the sheets of thy sails. We are thy fleet, Idaean pines from the holy hill, now nymphs of the sea. When the treacherous Rutulian urged us headlong with sword and fire, unwillingly we broke thy bonds, and we search for thee over ocean. This new guise our Lady made for us in pity, and granted us to be goddesses and spend our life under the waves. But thy boy Ascanius is held within wall and trench among the Latin weapons and the rough edge of war. Already the Arcadian cavalry and the brave Etruscan together hold the appointed ground. Turnus' plan is fixed to bar their way with his squadrons, that they may not reach the camp. Up and arise, and ere the coming of the Dawn bid thy crews be called to arms; and take thou the shield which the Lord of Fire forged for victory and rimmed about with gold. To-morrow's daylight, if thou deem not my words vain, shall see Rutulians heaped high in slaughter." She ended, and, as she went, pushed the tall ship on with her hand wisely and well; the ship shoots through the water fleeter than javelin or windswift arrow. Thereat the rest quicken their speed. The son of Anchises of Troy is himself deep in bewilderment; yet the omen cheers his courage. Then looking on the heavenly vault, he briefly prays: "O gracious upon Ida, mother of gods, whose delight is in Dindymus and turreted cities and lions coupled to thy rein, do thou lead me in battle, do thou meetly prosper thine augury, and draw nigh thy Phrygians, goddess, with favourable feet." Thus much he spoke; and meanwhile the broad light of returning day now began to pour in, and chased away the night. First he commands his comrades to follow his signals, brace their courage to arms and prepare for battle. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque dies caelo concesserat almaque curru<br>noctiuago Phoebe medium pulsabat Olympum:<br>Aeneas (neque enim membris dat cura quietem)<br>ipse sedens clauumque regit uelisque ministrat.<br>atque illi medio in spatio chorus, ecce, suarum<br>occurrit comitum: nymphae, quas alma Cybebe<br>numen habere maris nymphasque e nauibus esse<br>iusserat, innabant pariter fluctusque secabant,<br>quot prius aeratae steterant ad litora prorae.<br>agnoscunt longe regem lustrantque choreis;<br>quarum quae fandi doctissima Cymodocea<br>pone sequens dextra puppim tenet ipsaque dorso<br>eminet ac laeua tacitis subremigat undis.<br>tum sic ignarum adloquitur: 'uigilasne, deum gens,<br>Aenea? uigila et uelis immitte rudentis.<br>nos sumus, Idaeae sacro de uertice pinus,<br>nunc pelagi nymphae, classis tua. perfidus ut nos<br>praecipitis ferro Rutulus flammaque premebat,<br>rupimus inuitae tua uincula teque per aequor<br>quaerimus. hanc genetrix faciem miserata refecit<br>et dedit esse deas aeuumque agitare sub undis.<br>at puer Ascanius muro fossisque tenetur<br>tela inter media atque horrentis Marte Latinos.<br>iam loca iussa tenent forti permixtus Etrusco<br>Arcas eques; medias illis opponere turmas,<br>ne castris iungant, certa est sententia Turno.<br>surge age et Aurora socios ueniente uocari<br>primus in arma iube, et clipeum cape quem dedit ipse<br>inuictum ignipotens atque oras ambiit auro.<br>crastina lux, mea si non inrita dicta putaris,<br>ingentis Rutulae spectabit caedis aceruos.'<br>dixerat et dextra discedens impulit altam<br>haud ignara modi puppim: fugit illa per undas<br>ocior et iaculo et uentos aequante sagitta.<br>inde aliae celerant cursus. stupet inscius ipse<br>Tros Anchisiades, animos tamen omine tollit.<br>tum breuiter supera aspectans conuexa precatur:<br>'alma parens Idaea deum, cui Dindyma cordi<br>turrigeraeque urbes biiugique ad frena leones,<br>tu mihi nunc pugnae princeps, tu rite propinques<br>augurium Phrygibusque adsis pede, diua, secundo.'<br>tantum effatus, et interea reuoluta ruebat<br>matura iam luce dies noctemque fugarat;<br>principio sociis edicit signa sequantur<br>atque animos aptent armis pugnaeque parent se.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now his Trojans and his camp are in his sight as he stands high astern, when next he lifts the blazing shield on his left arm. The Dardanians on the walls raise a shout to the sky. Hope comes to kindle wrath; they hurl their missiles strongly; even as under black clouds cranes from the Strymon utter their signal notes and sail clamouring across the sky, and noisily stream down the gale. But this seemed marvellous to the Rutulian king and the captains of Ausonia, till looking back they see the ships steering for the beach, and all the sea as a single fleet sailing in. His helmet-spike blazes, flame pours from the cresting plumes, and the golden shield-boss spouts floods of fire; even as when in transparent night comets glow blood-red and drear, or the splendour of Sirius, that brings drought and sicknesses on wretched men, rises and saddens the sky with malignant beams. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque in conspectu Teucros habet et sua castra<br>stans celsa in puppi, clipeum cum deinde sinistra<br>extulit ardentem. clamorem ad sidera tollunt<br>Dardanidae e muris, spes addita suscitat iras,<br>tela manu iaciunt, quales sub nubibus atris<br>Strymoniae dant signa grues atque aethera tranant<br>cum sonitu, fugiuntque Notos clamore secundo.<br>at Rutulo regi ducibusque ea mira uideri<br>Ausoniis, donec uersas ad litora puppis<br>respiciunt totumque adlabi classibus aequor.<br>ardet apex capiti cristisque a uertice flamma<br>funditur et uastos umbo uomit aureus ignis:<br>non secus ac liquida si quando nocte cometae<br>sanguinei lugubre rubent, aut Sirius ardor<br>ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris<br>nascitur et laeuo contristat lumine caelum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Yet gallant Turnus in unfailing confidence will prevent them on the shore and repel their approach to land. "What your prayers have sought is given, the sweep of the sword-arm. The god of battles is in the hands of men. Now remember each his wife and home: now recall the high deeds of our fathers' honour. Let us challenge meeting at the water's edge, while they waver and their feet yet slip as they disembark. Fortune aids daring…" So speaks he, and counsels inly whom he shall lead to meet them, whom leave in charge of the leaguered walls. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haud tamen audaci Turno fiducia cessit<br>litora praecipere et uenientis pellere terra.<br>[ultro animos tollit dictis atque increpat ultro:]<br>'quod uotis optastis adest, perfringere dextra.<br>in manibus Mars ipse uiris. nunc coniugis esto<br>quisque suae tectique memor, nunc magna referto<br>facta, patrum laudes. ultro occurramus ad undam<br>dum trepidi egressisque labant uestigia prima.<br>audentis Fortuna iuuat.'<br>haec ait, et secum uersat quos ducere contra<br>uel quibus obsessos possit concredere muros.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile Aeneas lands his allies by gangways from the high ships. Many watch the retreat and slack of the sea, and leap boldly into the shoal water; others slide down the oars. Tarchon, marking the shore where the shallows do not seethe and plash with broken water, but the sea glides up and spreads its tide unbroken, suddenly turns his bows to land and implores his comrades: "Now, O chosen crew, bend strongly to your oars; lift your ships, make them go; let the prows cleave this hostile land and the keel plough herself a furrow. I will let my vessel break up on such harbourage if once she takes the land." When Tarchon had spoken in such wise, his comrades rise on their oar-blades and carry their ships in foam towards the Latin fields, till the prows are fast on dry land and all the keels are aground unhurt. But not thy galley, Tarchon; for she dashes on a shoal, and swings long swaying on the cruel bank, pitching and slapping the flood, then breaks up, and lands her crew among the waves. Broken oars and floating thwarts entangle them, and the ebbing wave sucks their feet away. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea Aeneas socios de puppibus altis<br>pontibus exponit. multi seruare recursus<br>languentis pelagi et breuibus se credere saltu,<br>per remos alii. speculatus litora Tarchon,<br>qua uada non sperat nec fracta remurmurat unda,<br>sed mare inoffensum crescenti adlabitur aestu,<br>aduertit subito proras sociosque precatur:<br>'nunc, o lecta manus, ualidis incumbite remis;<br>tollite, ferte rates, inimicam findite rostris<br>hanc terram, sulcumque sibi premat ipsa carina.<br>frangere nec tali puppim statione recuso<br>arrepta tellure semel.' quae talia postquam<br>effatus Tarchon, socii consurgere tonsis<br>spumantisque rates aruis inferre Latinis,<br>donec rostra tenent siccum et sedere carinae<br>omnes innocuae. sed non puppis tua, Tarchon:<br>namque inflicta uadis, dorso dum pendet iniquo<br>anceps sustentata diu fluctusque fatigat,<br>soluitur atque uiros mediis exponit in undis,<br>fragmina remorum quos et fluitantia transtra<br>impediunt retrahitque pedes simul unda relabens.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Nor does Turnus keep idly dallying, but swiftly hurries his whole array against the Trojans and ranges it to face the beach. The trumpets blow. At once Aeneas charges and confounds the rustic squadrons of the Latins, and slays Theron for omen of battle. The giant advances to challenge Aeneas; but through sewed plates of brass and tunic rough with gold the sword plunges in his open side. Next he strikes Lichas, cut from his mother already dead, and consecrated, Phoebus, to thee, since his infancy was granted escape from the perilous steel. Near thereby he struck dead brawny Cisseus and vast Gyas, whose clubs were mowing down whole files: naught availed them the arms of Hercules and their strength of hand, nor Melampus their father, ever of Alcides' company while earth yielded him sore travail. Lo! while Pharus utters weak vaunts the hurled javelin strikes on his shouting mouth. Thou too, while thou followest thy new delight, Clytius, whose cheeks are golden with youthful down—thou, luckless Cydon, struck down by the Dardanian hand, wert lying past thought, ah pitiable! of the young loves that were ever thine, did not the close array of thy brethren interpose, the children of Phorcus, seven in number, and send a sevenfold shower of darts. Some glance ineffectual from helmet and shield; some Venus the bountiful turned aside as they grazed his body. Aeneas calls to trusty Achates: "Give me store of weapons; none that hath been planted in Grecian body on the plains of Ilium shall my hand hurl at Rutulian in vain." Then he catches and throws his great spear; the spear flies grinding through the brass of Maeon's shield, and breaks through corslet and through breast. His brother Alcanor runs up and sustains with his right arm his sinking brother; through his arm the spear passes speeding straight on its message, and holds its bloody way, and the hand dangles by the sinews lifeless from the shoulder. Then Numitor, seizing his dead brother's javelin, aims at Aeneas, but might not fairly pierce him, and grazed tall Achates on the thigh. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nec Turnum segnis retinet mora, sed rapit acer<br>totam aciem in Teucros et contra in litore sistit.<br>signa canunt. primus turmas inuasit agrestis<br>Aeneas, omen pugnae, strauitque Latinos<br>occiso Therone, uirum qui maximus ultro<br>Aenean petit. huic gladio perque aerea suta,<br>per tunicam squalentem auro latus haurit apertum.<br>inde Lichan ferit exsectum iam matre perempta<br>et tibi, Phoebe, sacrum: casus euadere ferri<br>quo licuit paruo? nec longe Cissea durum<br>immanemque Gyan sternentis agmina claua<br>deiecit leto; nihil illos Herculis arma<br>nec ualidae iuuere manus genitorque Melampus,<br>Alcidae comes usque grauis dum terra labores<br>praebuit. ecce Pharo, uoces dum iactat inertis,<br>intorquens iaculum clamanti sistit in ore.<br>tu quoque, flauentem prima lanugine malas<br>dum sequeris Clytium infelix, noua gaudia, Cydon,<br>Dardania stratus dextra, securus amorum<br>qui iuuenum tibi semper erant, miserande iaceres,<br>ni fratrum stipata cohors foret obuia, Phorci<br>progenies, septem numero, septenaque tela<br>coniciunt; partim galea clipeoque resultant<br>inrita, deflexit partim stringentia corpus<br>alma Venus. fidum Aeneas adfatur Achaten:<br>'suggere tela mihi, non ullum dextera frustra<br>torserit in Rutulos, steterunt quae in corpore Graium<br>Iliacis campis.' tum magnam corripit hastam<br>et iacit: illa uolans clipei transuerberat aera<br>Maeonis et thoraca simul cum pectore rumpit.<br>huic frater subit Alcanor fratremque ruentem<br>sustentat dextra: traiecto missa lacerto<br>protinus hasta fugit seruatque cruenta tenorem,<br>dexteraque ex umero neruis moribunda pependit.<br>tum Numitor iaculo fratris de corpore rapto<br>Aenean petiit: sed non et figere contra<br>est licitum, magnique femur perstrinxit Achatae.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Here Clausus of Cures comes confident in his pride of strength, and with a long reach strikes Dryops under the chin, and, urging the stiff spear-shaft home, stops the accents of his speech and his life together, piercing the throat; but he strikes the earth with his forehead, and vomits clots of blood. Three Thracians likewise of Boreas' sovereign race, and three sent by their father Idas from their native Ismarus, fall in divers wise before him. Halesus and his Auruncan troops hasten thither; Messapus too, seed of Neptune, comes up charioted. This side and that strive to hurl back the enemy, and fight hard on the very edge of Ausonia. As when in the depth of air adverse winds rise in battle with equal spirit and strength; not they, not clouds nor sea, yield one to another; long the battle is doubtful; all stands locked in counterpoise: even thus clash the ranks of Troy and ranks of Latium, foot fast on foot, and man crowded up on man. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hic Curibus fidens primaeuo corpore Clausus<br>aduenit et rigida Dryopem ferit eminus hasta<br>sub mentum grauiter pressa, pariterque loquentis<br>uocem animamque rapit traiecto gutture; at ille<br>fronte ferit terram et crassum uomit ore cruorem.<br>tris quoque Threicios Boreae de gente suprema<br>et tris quos Idas pater et patria Ismara mittit,<br>per uarios sternit casus. accurrit Halaesus<br>Auruncaeque manus, subit et Neptunia proles,<br>insignis Messapus equis. expellere tendunt<br>nunc hi, nunc illi: certatur limine in ipso<br>Ausoniae. magno discordes aethere uenti<br>proelia ceu tollunt animis et uiribus aequis;<br>non ipsi inter se, non nubila, non mare cedit;<br>anceps pugna diu, stant obnixa omnia contra:<br>haud aliter Troianae acies aciesque Latinae<br>concurrunt, haeret pede pes densusque uiro uir.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But in another quarter, where a torrent had driven a wide path of rolling stones and bushes torn away from the banks, Pallas saw his Arcadians, unaccustomed to move as infantry, giving back before the Latin pursuit, when the roughness of the ground bade them dismount. This only was left in his strait, to kindle them to valour, now by entreaties, now by taunts: "Whither flee you, comrades? by your deeds of bravery, by your leader Evander's name, by your triumphant campaigns, and my hope that now rises to rival my father's honour, trust not to flight. Our swords must hew a way through the enemy. Where yonder mass of men presses thickest, there your proud country calls you with Pallas at your head. No gods are they who bear us down; mortals, we feel the pressure of a mortal foe; we have as many lives and hands as he. Lo, the deep shuts us in with vast sea barrier; even now land fails our flight; shall we make ocean or Troy our goal?" So speaks he, and bursts amid the serried foe. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At parte ex alia, qua saxa rotantia late<br>intulerat torrens arbustaque diruta ripis,<br>Arcadas insuetos acies inferre pedestris<br>ut uidit Pallas Latio dare terga sequaci,<br>aspera aquis natura loci dimittere quando<br>suasit equos, unum quod rebus restat egenis,<br>nunc prece, nunc dictis uirtutem accendit amaris;<br>'quo fugitis, socii? per uos et fortia facta,<br>per ducis Euandri nomen deuictaque bella<br>spemque meam, patriae quae nunc subit aemula laudi,<br>fidite ne pedibus. ferro rumpenda per hostis<br>est uia. qua globus ille uirum densissimus urget,<br>hac uos et Pallanta ducem patria alta reposcit.<br>numina nulla premunt, mortali urgemur ab hoste<br>mortales; totidem nobis animaeque manusque.<br>ecce maris magna claudit nos obice pontus,<br>deest iam terra fugae: pelagus Troiamne petamus?'<br>haec ait, et medius densos prorumpit in hostis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>First Lagus meets him, drawn thither by malign destiny; him, as he tugs at a ponderous stone, hurling his spear where the spine ran dissevering the ribs, he pierces and wrenches out the spear where it stuck fast in the bone. Nor does Hisbo catch him stooping, for all that he hoped it; for Pallas, as he rushes unguarded on, furious at his comrade's cruel death, receives him on his sword and buries it in his distended lungs. Next he attacks Sthenius, and Anchemolus of Rhoetus' ancient family, who dared to violate the bridal chamber of his stepmother. You, too, the twins Larides and Thymber, fell on the Rutulian fields, children of Daucus, indistinguishable for likeness and a sweet perplexity to your parents. But now Pallas made cruel difference between you; for thy head, Thymber, is swept off by Evander's sword; thy right hand, Larides, severed, seeks its master, and the dying fingers jerk and clutch at the sword. Fired by his encouragement, and beholding his noble deeds, the Arcadians advance in wrath and shame to meet the enemy in arms. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Obuius huic primum fatis adductus iniquis<br>fit Lagus. hunc, uellit magno dum pondere saxum,<br>intorto figit telo, discrimina costis<br>per medium qua spina dabat, hastamque receptat<br>ossibus haerentem. quem non super occupat Hisbo,<br>ille quidem hoc sperans; nam Pallas ante ruentem,<br>dum furit, incautum crudeli morte sodalis<br>excipit atque ensem tumido in pulmone recondit.<br>hinc Sthenium petit et Rhoeti de gente uetusta<br>Anchemolum thalamos ausum incestare nouercae.<br>uos etiam, gemini, Rutulis cecidistis in aruis,<br>Daucia, Laride Thymberque, simillima proles,<br>indiscreta suis gratusque parentibus error;<br>at nunc dura dedit uobis discrimina Pallas.<br>nam tibi, Thymbre, caput Euandrius abstulit ensis;<br>te decisa suum, Laride, dextera quaerit<br>semianimesque micant digiti ferrumque retractant.<br>Arcadas accensos monitu et praeclara tuentis<br>facta uiri mixtus dolor et pudor armat in hostis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then Pallas pierces Rhoeteus as he flies past in his chariot. This space, this much of respite was given to Ilus; for at Ilus he had aimed the strong spear from afar, and Rhoeteus intercepts its passage, in flight from thee, noble Teuthras and Tyres thy brother; he rolls from the chariot in death, and his heels strike the Rutulian fields. And as the shepherd, when summer winds have risen to his desire, kindles the woods dispersedly; on a sudden the mid spaces catch, and a single flickering line of fire spreads wide over the plain; he sits looking down on his conquest and the revel of the flames; even so, Pallas, do thy brave comrades gather close to sustain thee. But warrior Halesus advances full on them, gathering himself behind his armour; he slays Ladon, Pheres, Demodocus; his gleaming sword shears off Strymonius' hand as it rises to his throat; he strikes Thoas on the face with a stone, and drives the bones asunder in a shattered mass of blood and brains. Halesus had his father the soothsayer kept hidden in the woodland: when the old man's glazing eyes sank to death, the Fates laid hand on him and devoted him to the arms of Evander. Pallas aims at him, first praying thus: "Grant now, lord Tiber, to the steel I poise and hurl, a prosperous way through brawny Halesus' breast; thine oak shall bear these arms and the dress he wore." The god heard it; while Halesus covers Imaon, he leaves, alas! his breast unarmed to the Arcadian's weapon. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum Pallas biiugis fugientem Rhoetea praeter<br>traicit. hoc spatium tantumque morae fuit Ilo;<br>Ilo namque procul ualidam derexerat hastam,<br>quam medius Rhoeteus intercipit, optime Teuthra,<br>te fugiens fratremque Tyren, curruque uolutus<br>caedit semianimis Rutulorum calcibus arua.<br>ac uelut optato uentis aestate coortis<br>dispersa immittit siluis incendia pastor,<br>correptis subito mediis extenditur una<br>horrida per latos acies Volcania campos,<br>ille sedens uictor flammas despectat ouantis:<br>non aliter socium uirtus coit omnis in unum<br>teque iuuat, Palla. sed bellis acer Halaesus<br>tendit in aduersos seque in sua colligit arma.<br>hic mactat Ladona Pheretaque Demodocumque,<br>Strymonio dextram fulgenti deripit ense<br>elatam in iugulum, saxo ferit ora Thoantis<br>ossaque dispersit cerebro permixta cruento.<br>fata canens siluis genitor celarat Halaesum;<br>ut senior leto canentia lumina soluit,<br>iniecere manum Parcae telisque sacrarunt<br>Euandri. quem sic Pallas petit ante precatus:<br>'da nunc, Thybri pater, ferro, quod missile libro,<br>fortunam atque uiam duri per pectus Halaesi.<br>haec arma exuuiasque uiri tua quercus habebit.'<br>audiit illa deus; dum texit Imaona Halaesus,<br>Arcadio infelix telo dat pectus inermum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Yet at his grievous death Lausus, himself a great arm of the war, lets not his columns be dismayed; at once he meets and cuts down Abas, the check and stay of their battle. The men of Arcadia go down before him; down go the Etruscans, and you, O Teucrians, invincible by Greece. The armies close, matched in strength and in captains; the rear ranks crowd in; weapons and hands are locked in the press. Here Pallas strains and pushes on, here Lausus opposite, nearly matched in age, excellent in beauty; but fortune had denied both return to their own land. Yet that they should meet face to face the sovereign of high Olympus allowed not; an early fate awaits them beneath a mightier foe. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At non caede uiri tanta perterrita Lausus,<br>pars ingens belli, sinit agmina: primus Abantem<br>oppositum interimit, pugnae nodumque moramque.<br>sternitur Arcadiae proles, sternuntur Etrusci<br>et uos, o Grais imperdita corpora, Teucri.<br>agmina concurrunt ducibusque et uiribus aequis;<br>extremi addensent acies nec turba moueri<br>tela manusque sinit. hinc Pallas instat et urget,<br>hinc contra Lausus, nec multum discrepat aetas,<br>egregii forma, sed quis Fortuna negarat<br>in patriam reditus. ipsos concurrere passus<br>haud tamen inter se magni regnator Olympi;<br>mox illos sua fata manent maiore sub hoste.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile Turnus' gracious sister bids him take Lausus' room, and his fleet chariot parts the ranks. When he saw his comrades, "It is time," he cried, "to stay from battle. I alone must assail Pallas; to me and none other Pallas is due; I would his father himself were here to see." So speaks he, and his Rutulians draw back from a level space at his bidding. But then as they withdrew, he, wondering at the haughty command, stands in amaze at Turnus, his eyes scanning the vast frame, and his fierce glance perusing him from afar. And with these words he returns the words of the monarch: "For me, my praise shall even now be in the lordly spoils I win, or in illustrious death: my father will bear calmly either lot: away with menaces." He speaks, and advances into the level ring. The Arcadians' blood gathers chill about their hearts. Turnus leaps from his chariot and prepares to close with him. And as a lion sees from some lofty outlook a bull stand far off on the plain revolving battle, and flies at him, even such to see is Turnus' coming. When Pallas deemed him within reach of a spear-throw, he advances, if so chance may assist the daring of his overmatched strength, and thus cries into the depth of sky: "By my father's hospitality and the board whereto thou camest a wanderer, on thee I call, Alcides; be favourable to my high emprise; let Turnus even in death discern me stripping his blood-stained armour, and his swooning eyes endure the sight of his conqueror." Alcides heard him, and deep in his heart he stifled a heavy sigh, and let idle tears fall. Then with kindly words the father accosts his son: "Each hath his own appointed day; short and irrecoverable is the span of life for all: but to spread renown by deeds is the task of valour. Under high Troy town many and many a god's son fell; nay, mine own child Sarpedon likewise perished. Turnus too his own fate summons, and his allotted period hath reached the goal." So speaks he, and turns his eyes away from the Rutulian fields. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea soror alma monet succedere Lauso<br>Turnum, qui uolucri curru medium secat agmen.<br>ut uidit socios: 'tempus desistere pugnae;<br>solus ego in Pallanta feror, soli mihi Pallas<br>debetur; cuperem ipse parens spectator adesset.'<br>haec ait, et socii cesserunt aequore iusso.<br>at Rutulum abscessu iuuenis tum iussa superba<br>miratus stupet in Turno corpusque per ingens<br>lumina uoluit obitque truci procul omnia uisu,<br>talibus et dictis it contra dicta tyranni:<br>'aut spoliis ego iam raptis laudabor opimis<br>aut leto insigni: sorti pater aequus utrique est.<br>tolle minas.' fatus medium procedit in aequor;<br>frigidus Arcadibus coit in praecordia sanguis.<br>desiluit Turnus biiugis, pedes apparat ire<br>comminus; utque leo, specula cum uidit ab alta<br>stare procul campis meditantem in proelia taurum,<br>aduolat, haud alia est Turni uenientis imago.<br>hunc ubi contiguum missae fore credidit hastae,<br>ire prior Pallas, si qua fors adiuuet ausum<br>uiribus imparibus, magnumque ita ad aethera fatur:<br>'per patris hospitium et mensas, quas aduena adisti,<br>te precor, Alcide, coeptis ingentibus adsis.<br>cernat semineci sibi me rapere arma cruenta<br>uictoremque ferant morientia lumina Turni.'<br>audiit Alcides iuuenem magnumque sub imo<br>corde premit gemitum lacrimasque effundit inanis.<br>tum genitor natum dictis adfatur amicis:<br>'stat sua cuique dies, breue et inreparabile tempus<br>omnibus est uitae; sed famam extendere factis,<br>hoc uirtutis opus.

The flying spear lights where the armour rises high above the shoulder, and, forcing a way through the shield's rim, ceased not till it drew blood from mighty Turnus. At this Turnus long poises the spear-shaft with its sharp steel head, and hurls it on Pallas with these words: <i>See thou if our weapon have not a keener point.</i> He ended; but for all the shield's plating of iron and brass, for all the bull-hide that covers it round about, the quivering spear-head smashes it fair through and through, passes the guard of the corslet, and pierces the breast with a gaping hole. He tears the warm weapon from the wound; in vain; together and at once life-blood and sense follow it. He falls heavily on the ground, his armour clashes over him, and his bloodstained face sinks in death on the hostile soil. And Turnus standing over him …: "Arcadians," he cries, "remember these my words, and bear them to Evander. I send him back his Pallas as was due. All the meed of the tomb, all the solace of sepulture, I give freely. Dearly must he pay his welcome to Aeneas." And with these words, planting his left foot on the dead, he tore away the broad heavy sword-belt engraven with a tale of crime, the array of grooms foully slain together on their bridal night, and the nuptial chambers dabbled with blood, which Clonus, son of Eurytus, had wrought richly in gold. Now Turnus exults in spoiling him of it, and rejoices at his prize. Ah spirit of man, ignorant of fate and the allotted future, or to keep bounds when elate with prosperity!—the day will come when Turnus shall desire to have bought Pallas' safety at a great ransom, and curse the spoils of this fatal day. But with many moans and tears Pallas' comrades lay him on his shield and bear him away amid their ranks. O grief and glory and grace of the father to whom thou shalt return! This one day sent thee first to war, this one day takes thee away, while yet thou leavest heaped high thy Rutulian dead. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At Pallas magnis emittit uiribus hastam<br>uaginaque caua fulgentem deripit ensem.<br>illa uolans umeri surgunt qua tegmina summa<br>incidit, atque uiam clipei molita per oras<br>tandem etiam magno strinxit de corpore Turni.<br>hic Turnus ferro praefixum robur acuto<br>in Pallanta diu librans iacit atque ita fatur:<br>'aspice num mage sit nostrum penetrabile telum.'<br>dixerat; at clipeum, tot ferri terga, tot aeris,<br>quem pellis totiens obeat circumdata tauri,<br>uibranti cuspis medium transuerberat ictu<br>loricaeque moras et pectus perforat ingens.<br>ille rapit calidum frustra de uulnere telum:<br>una eademque uia sanguis animusque sequuntur.<br>corruit in uulnus (sonitum super arma dedere)<br>et terram hostilem moriens petit ore cruento.<br>quem Turnus super adsistens:<br>'Arcades, haec' inquit 'memores mea dicta referte<br>Euandro: qualem meruit, Pallanta remitto.<br>quisquis honos tumuli, quidquid solamen humandi est,<br>largior. haud illi stabunt Aeneia paruo<br>hospitia.' et laeuo pressit pede talia fatus<br>exanimem rapiens immania pondera baltei<br>impressumque nefas: una sub nocte iugali<br>caesa manus iuuenum foede thalamique cruenti,<br>quae Clonus Eurytides multo caelauerat auro;<br>quo nunc Turnus ouat spolio gaudetque potitus.<br>nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae<br>et seruare modum rebus sublata secundis!<br>Turno tempus erit magno cum optauerit emptum<br>intactum Pallanta, et cum spolia ista diemque<br>oderit. at socii multo gemitu lacrimisque<br>impositum scuto referunt Pallanta frequentes.<br>o dolor atque decus magnum rediture parenti,<br>haec te prima dies bello dedit, haec eadem aufert,<br>cum tamen ingentis Rutulorum linquis aceruos!</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now no rumour of the dreadful loss, but a surer messenger flies to Aeneas, telling him his troops are on the thin edge of doom; it is time to succour the routed Teucrians. He mows down all that meets him, and hews a broad path through their columns with furious sword, as he seeks thee, O Turnus, in thy fresh pride of slaughter. Pallas, Evander, all flash before his eyes; the board whereto but then he had first come a wanderer, and the clasped hands. Here four of Sulmo's children, as many more of Ufens' nurture, are taken by him alive to slaughter in sacrifice to the shade below, and slake the flames of the pyre with captive blood. Next he levelled his spear full on Magus from far. He stoops cunningly; the spear flies quivering over him; and, clasping his knees, he speaks thus beseechingly: "By thy father's ghost, by Iülus thy growing hope, I entreat thee, save this life for a child and a parent. My house is stately; deep in it lies buried wealth of engraven silver; I have masses of wrought and unwrought gold. The victory of Troy does not turn on this, nor will a single life make so great a difference." He ended; to him Aeneas thus returns answer: "All the wealth of silver and gold thou tellest of, spare thou for thy children. Turnus hath broken off this thy trafficking in war, even then when Pallas fell. Thus judges the ghost of my father Anchises, thus Iülus." So speaking, he grasps his helmet with his left hand, and, bending back his neck, drives his sword up to the hilt in the suppliant. Hard by is Haemonides, priest of Phoebus and Trivia, his temples wound with the holy ribboned chaplet, all glittering in white-robed array.

The Dardanian rushes full on them. His sword had hewn off Anxur's left arm, with all the circle of the shield—he had uttered brave words and deemed his prowess would second his vaunts, and perchance with spirit lifted up had promised himself hoar age and length of years—when Tarquitus in the pride of his glittering arms met his fiery course, whom the nymph Dryope had borne to Faunus, haunter of the woodland. Drawing back his spear, he pins the ponderous shield to the corslet; then, as he vainly pleaded and would say many a thing, strikes his head to the ground, and, rolling away the warm body, cries thus over his enemy: "Lie there now, terrible one! no mother's love shall lay thee in the sod, or place thy limbs beneath thine heavy ancestral tomb. To birds of prey shalt thou be left, or borne down sunk in the eddying water, where hungry fish shall suck thy wounds." Next he sweeps on Antaeus and Lucas, the first of Turnus' train, and brave Numa and tawny-haired Camers, born of noble Volscens, who was wealthiest in land of the Ausonians, and reigned in silent Amyclae. Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had an hundred arms, an hundred hands, fifty mouths and breasts ablaze with fire, and arrayed against Jove's thunders as many clashing shields and drawn swords: so Aeneas, when once his sword's point grew warm, rages victorious over all the field. Nay, lo! he darts full in face on Niphaeus' four-horse chariot; before his long strides and dreadful cry they turned in terror and dashed back, throwing out their driver and tearing the chariot down the beach. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Instaurant acies Volcani stirpe creatus<br>Caeculus et ueniens Marsorum montibus Vmbro.<br>Dardanides contra furit: Anxuris ense sinistram<br>et totum clipei ferro deiecerat orbem<br>(dixerat ille aliquid magnum uimque adfore uerbo<br>crediderat, caeloque animum fortasse ferebat<br>canitiemque sibi et longos promiserat annos);<br>Tarquitus exsultans contra fulgentibus armis,<br>siluicolae Fauno Dryope quem nympha crearat,<br>obuius ardenti sese obtulit. ille reducta<br>loricam clipeique ingens onus impedit hasta,<br>tum caput orantis nequiquam et multa parantis<br>dicere deturbat terrae, truncumque tepentem<br>prouoluens super haec inimico pectore fatur:<br>'istic nunc, metuende, iace. non te optima mater<br>condet humi patrioque onerabit membra sepulcro:<br>alitibus linquere feris, aut gurgite mersum<br>unda feret piscesque impasti uulnera lambent.'<br>protinus Antaeum et Lucam, prima agmina Turni,<br>persequitur, fortemque Numam fuluumque Camertem,<br>magnanimo Volcente satum, ditissimus agri<br>qui fuit Ausonidum et tacitis regnauit Amyclis.<br>Aegaeon qualis, centum cui bracchia dicunt<br>centenasque manus, quinquaginta oribus ignem<br>pectoribusque arsisse, Iouis cum fulmina contra<br>tot paribus streperet clipeis, tot stringeret ensis:<br>sic toto Aeneas desaeuit in aequore uictor<br>ut semel intepuit mucro. quin ecce Niphaei<br>quadriiugis in equos aduersaque pectora tendit.<br>atque illi longe gradientem et dira frementem<br>ut uidere, metu uersi retroque ruentes<br>effunduntque ducem rapiuntque ad litora currus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile the brothers Lucagus and Liger drive up with their pair of white horses. Lucagus valiantly waves his drawn sword, while his brother wheels his horses with the rein. Aeneas, wrathful at their mad onslaught, rushes on them, towering high with levelled spear. To him Liger … "Not Diomede's horses dost thou discern, nor Achilles' chariot, nor the plains of Phrygia: now on this soil of ours the war and thy life shall end together." Thus fly mad Liger's random words. But not in words does the Trojan hero frame his reply: for he hurls his javelin at the foe. As Lucagus spurred on his horses, bending forward over the whip, with left foot advanced ready for battle, the spear passes through the lower rim of his shining shield and pierces his left groin, knocks him out of the chariot, and stretches him in death on the fields. To him good Aeneas speaks in bitter words: "Lucagus, no slackness in thy coursers' flight hath betrayed thee, or vain shadow of the foe turned them back; thyself thou leapest off the harnessed wheels." In such wise he spoke, and caught the horses. His brother, slipping down from the chariot, pitiably outstretched helpless hands: "Ah, by the parents who gave thee birth, great Trojan, spare this life and pity my prayer." More he was pleading; but Aeneas: "Not such were the words thou wert uttering. Die, and be brother undivided from brother." With that his sword's point pierces the breast where the life lies hid. Thus the Dardanian captain dealt death over the plain, like some raging torrent stream or black whirlwind. At last the boy Ascanius and his troops burst through the ineffectual leaguer and issue from the camp. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea biiugis infert se Lucagus albis<br>in medios fraterque Liger; sed frater habenis<br>flectit equos, strictum rotat acer Lucagus ensem.<br>haud tulit Aeneas tanto feruore furentis;<br>inruit aduersaque ingens apparuit hasta.<br>cui Liger:<br>'non Diomedis equos nec currum cernis Achilli<br>aut Phrygiae campos: nunc belli finis et aeui<br>his dabitur terris.' uesano talia late<br>dicta uolant Ligeri. sed non et Troius heros<br>dicta parat contra, iaculum nam torquet in hostis.<br>Lucagus ut pronus pendens in uerbera telo<br>admonuit biiugos, proiecto dum pede laeuo<br>aptat se pugnae, subit oras hasta per imas<br>fulgentis clipei, tum laeuum perforat inguen;<br>excussus curru moribundus uoluitur aruis.<br>quem pius Aeneas dictis adfatur amaris:<br>'Lucage, nulla tuos currus fuga segnis equorum<br>prodidit aut uanae uertere ex hostibus umbrae:<br>ipse rotis saliens iuga deseris.' haec ita fatus<br>arripuit biiugos; frater tendebat inertis<br>infelix palmas curru delapsus eodem:<br>'per te, per qui te talem genuere parentes,<br>uir Troiane, sine hanc animam et miserere precantis.'<br>pluribus oranti Aeneas: 'haud talia dudum<br>dicta dabas. morere et fratrem ne desere frater.'<br>tum latebras animae pectus mucrone recludit.<br>talia per campos edebat funera ductor<br>Dardanius torrentis aquae uel turbinis atri<br>more furens. tandem erumpunt et castra relinquunt<br>Ascanius puer et nequiquam obsessa iuuentus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile Jupiter breaks silence to accost Juno: "O sister and wife best beloved, it is Venus, as thou deemedst, nor is thy judgment astray, who sustains the forces of Troy; not their own valour of hand in war, and untamable spirit and endurance in peril." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iunonem interea compellat Iuppiter ultro:<br>'o germana mihi atque eadem gratissima coniunx,<br>ut rebare, Venus (nec te sententia fallit)<br>Troianas sustentat opes, non uiuida bello<br>dextra uiris animusque ferox patiensque pericli.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>To whom Juno beseechingly: "Why, fair my lord, vexest thou one sick at heart and trembling at thy bitter words?

Then the goddess, strange and ominous to see, fashions into the likeness of Aeneas a thin and pithless shade of hollow mist, decks it with Dardanian weapons, and gives it the mimicry of shield and divine helmet plume, gives unsubstantial words and senseless utterance, and the mould and motion of his tread: like shapes rumoured to flit when death is past, or dreams that delude the slumbering senses. But in front of the battle-ranks the phantom dances rejoicingly, and with arms and mocking accents provokes the foe. Turnus hastens up and sends his spear whistling from far on it; it gives back and turns its footsteps. Then indeed Turnus, when he believed Aeneas turned and fled from him, and his spirit madly drank in the illusive hope: "Whither fliest thou, Aeneas? forsake not thy plighted bridal chamber. This hand shall give thee the land thou hast sought overseas." So clamouring he pursues, and brandishes his drawn sword, and sees not that his rejoicing is drifting with the winds. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta dedit, caelo se protinus alto<br>misit agens hiemem nimbo succincta per auras,<br>Iliacamque aciem et Laurentia castra petiuit.<br>tum dea nube caua tenuem sine uiribus umbram<br>in faciem Aeneae (uisu mirabile monstrum)<br>Dardaniis ornat telis, clipeumque iubasque<br>diuini adsimulat capitis, dat inania uerba,<br>dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis,<br>morte obita qualis fama est uolitare figuras<br>aut quae sopitos deludunt somnia sensus.<br>at primas laeta ante acies exsultat imago<br>inritatque uirum telis et uoce lacessit.<br>instat cui Turnus stridentemque eminus hastam<br>conicit; illa dato uertit uestigia tergo.<br>tum uero Aenean auersum ut cedere Turnus<br>credidit atque animo spem turbidus hausit inanem:<br>'quo fugis, Aenea? thalamos ne desere pactos;<br>hac dabitur dextra tellus quaesita per undas.'<br>talia uociferans sequitur strictumque coruscat<br>mucronem, nec ferre uidet sua gaudia uentos.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The ship lay haply moored to a high ledge of rock, with ladders run out and gangway ready, wherein king Osinius sailed from the coasts of Clusium. Here the fluttering phantom of flying Aeneas darts and hides itself. Nor is Turnus slack to follow; he overleaps the barriers and springs across the high gangways. Scarcely had he lighted on the prow; the daughter of Saturn snaps the hawser, and the ship, parted from her cable, runs out on the ebbing tide. And him Aeneas seeks for battle and finds not, and sends many a man that meets him to death. Then the light phantom seeks not yet any further hiding-place, but, flitting aloft, melts in a dark cloud; and a blast comes down meanwhile and sweeps Turnus through the seas. He looks back, witless of his case and thankless for his salvation, and, wailing, stretches both hands to heaven: "Father omnipotent, was I so guilty in thine eyes, and is this the punishment thou hast ordained? Whither am I borne? whence came I? what flight is this, or in what guise do I return? Shall I look again on the camp or walls of Laurentum? What of that array of men who followed me to arms? whom—oh horrible!—I have abandoned all amid a dreadful death; and now I see the stragglers and catch the groans of those who fall. What do I? or how may earth ever yawn for me deep enough? Do you rather, O winds, be pitiful, carry my bark on rock or reef; it is I, Turnus, who desire and implore you; or drive me on the cruel shoals of the Syrtis, where no Rutulian may follow nor rumour know my name." Thus speaking, he wavers in mind this way and that: maddened by the shame, shall he plunge on his sword's harsh point and drive it through his side, or fling himself among the waves, and seek by swimming to gain the winding shore, again to return on the Trojan arms? Thrice he essayed either way; thrice queenly Juno checked and restrained him in pity of heart. Cleaving the deep, he floats with the tide down the flood, and is borne on to his father Daunus' ancient city. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Forte ratis celsi coniuncta crepidine saxi<br>expositis stabat scalis et ponte parato,<br>qua rex Clusinis aduectus Osinius oris.<br>huc sese trepida Aeneae fugientis imago<br>conicit in latebras, nec Turnus segnior instat<br>exsuperatque moras et pontis transilit altos.<br>uix proram attigerat, rumpit Saturnia funem<br>auulsamque rapit reuoluta per aequora nauem.<br>illum autem Aeneas absentem in proelia poscit;<br>obuia multa uirum demittit corpora morti,<br>tum leuis haud ultra latebras iam quaerit imago,<br>sed sublime uolans nubi se immiscuit atrae,<br>cum Turnum medio interea fert aequore turbo.<br>respicit ignarus rerum ingratusque salutis<br>et duplicis cum uoce manus ad sidera tendit:<br>'omnipotens genitor, tanton me crimine dignum<br>duxisti et talis uoluisti expendere poenas?<br>quo feror? unde abii? quae me fuga quemue reducit?<br>Laurentisne iterum muros aut castra uidebo?<br>quid manus illa uirum, qui me meaque arma secuti?<br>quosque (nefas) omnis infanda in morte reliqui<br>et nunc palantis uideo, gemitumque cadentum<br>accipio? quid ago? aut quae iam satis ima dehiscat<br>terra mihi? uos o potius miserescite, uenti;<br>in rupes, in saxa (uolens uos Turnus adoro)<br>ferte ratem saeuisque uadis immittite syrtis,<br>quo nec me Rutuli nec conscia fama sequatur.'<br>haec memorans animo nunc huc, nunc fluctuat illuc,<br>an sese mucrone ob tantum dedecus amens<br>induat et crudum per costas exigat ensem,<br>fluctibus an iaciat mediis et litora nando<br>curua petat Teucrumque iterum se reddat in arma.<br>ter conatus utramque uiam, ter maxima Iuno<br>continuit iuuenemque animi miserata repressit.<br>labitur alta secans fluctuque aestuque secundo<br>et patris antiquam Dauni defertur ad urbem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But meanwhile at Jove's prompting fiery Mezentius takes his place in the battle and assails the triumphant Teucrians. The Tyrrhene ranks gather round him, and all at once in unison shower their darts down on the hated foe. As a cliff that juts into the waste of waves, meeting the raging winds and breasting the deep, endures all the threatening force of sky and sea, itself fixed immovable, so he dashes to earth Hebrus son of Dolichaon, and with him Latagus, and Palmus as he fled; catching Latagus full front in the face with a vast fragment of mountain rock, while Palmus he hamstrings, and leaves him rolling helpless; his armour he gives Lausus to wear on his shoulders, and the plumes to fix on his crest. With them fall Evanthes the Phrygian, and Mimas, fellow and birthmate of Paris; for on one night Theano bore him to his father Amycus, and the queen, Cisseus' daughter, was delivered of Paris the firebrand; he sleeps in his fathers' city; Mimas lies a stranger on the Laurentian coast. And as the boar driven by snapping hounds from the mountain heights, many a year hidden by Vesulus in his pines, many an one fed in the Laurentian marsh among the reedy forest, once come among the nets, halts and snorts savagely, with shoulders bristling up, and none of them dare be wrathful or draw closer, but they shower from a safe distance their darts and cries; even thus none of those whose anger is righteous against Mezentius have courage to meet him with drawn weapon: far off they provoke him with missiles and huge clamour, and he turns slow and fearless round about, grinding his teeth as he shakes the spears off his shield. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At Iouis interea monitis Mezentius ardens<br>succedit pugnae Teucrosque inuadit ouantis.<br>concurrunt Tyrrhenae acies atque omnibus uni,<br>uni odiisque uiro telisque frequentibus instant.<br>ille (uelut rupes uastum quae prodit in aequor,<br>obuia uentorum furiis expostaque ponto,<br>uim cunctam atque minas perfert caelique marisque<br>ipsa immota manens) prolem Dolichaonis Hebrum<br>sternit humi, cum quo Latagum Palmumque fugacem,<br>sed Latagum saxo atque ingenti fragmine montis<br>occupat os faciemque aduersam, poplite Palmum<br>succiso uolui segnem sinit, armaque Lauso<br>donat habere umeris et uertice figere cristas.<br>nec non Euanthen Phrygium Paridisque Mimanta<br>aequalem comitemque, una quem nocte Theano<br>in lucem genitore Amyco dedit et face praegnas<br>Cisseis regina Parim; Paris urbe paterna<br>occubat, ignarum Laurens habet ora Mimanta.<br>ac uelut ille canum morsu de montibus altis<br>actus aper, multos Vesulus quem pinifer annos<br>defendit multosque palus Laurentia silua<br>pascit harundinea, postquam inter retia uentum est,<br>substitit infremuitque ferox et inhorruit armos,<br>nec cuiquam irasci propiusue accedere uirtus,<br>sed iaculis tutisque procul clamoribus instant;<br>haud aliter, iustae quibus est Mezentius irae,<br>non ulli est animus stricto concurrere ferro,<br>missilibus longe et uasto clamore lacessunt.<br>ille autem impauidus partis cunctatur in omnis<br>dentibus infrendens et tergo decutit hastas:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>From the bounds of ancient Corythus Acron the Greek had come, leaving for exile a bride half won. Seeing him afar dealing confusion amid the ranks, in crimson plumes and his plighted wife's purple,—as an unpastured lion often ranging the deep coverts, for madness of hunger urges him, if he haply catches sight of a timorous roe or high-antlered stag, he gapes hugely for joy, and, with mane on end, clings crouching over its flesh, his cruel mouth bathed in reeking gore… so Mezentius darts lightly among the thick of the enemy. Hapless Acron goes down, and, spurning the dark ground, gasps out his life, and covers the broken javelin with his blood. But the victor deigned not to bring down Orodes with the blind wound of his flying lance as he fled; full face to face he meets him, and engages man with man, conqueror not by stealth but armed valour. Then, as with planted foot, he thrust him off the spear: "O men," he cries, "Orodes lies low, no slight arm of the war." His comrades shout after him the glad battle chant. And the dying man: "Not unavenged nor long, whoso thou art, shalt thou be glad in victory: thee too an equal fate marks down, and in these fields thou shalt soon lie." And smiling on him half wrathfully, Mezentius: "Now die thou. But of me let the father of gods and king of men take counsel." So saying, he drew the weapon out of his body. Grim rest and iron slumber seal his eyes; his lids close on everlasting night. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Venerat antiquis Corythi de finibus Acron,<br>Graius homo, infectos linquens profugus hymenaeos.<br>hunc ubi miscentem longe media agmina uidit,<br>purpureum pennis et pactae coniugis ostro,<br>impastus stabula alta leo ceu saepe peragrans<br>(suadet enim uesana fames), si forte fugacem<br>conspexit capream aut surgentem in cornua ceruum,<br>gaudet hians immane comasque arrexit et haeret<br>uisceribus super incumbens; lauit improba taeter<br>ora cruor—<br>sic ruit in densos alacer Mezentius hostis.<br>sternitur infelix Acron et calcibus atram<br>tundit humum exspirans infractaque tela cruentat.<br>atque idem fugientem haud est dignatus Oroden<br>sternere nec iacta caecum dare cuspide uulnus;<br>obuius aduersoque occurrit seque uiro uir<br>contulit, haud furto melior sed fortibus armis.<br>tum super abiectum posito pede nixus et hasta:<br>'pars belli haud temnenda, uiri, iacet altus Orodes.'<br>conclamant socii laetum paeana secuti;<br>ille autem exspirans: 'non me, quicumque es, inulto,<br>uictor, nec longum laetabere; te quoque fata<br>prospectant paria atque eadem mox arua tenebis.'<br>ad quem subridens mixta Mezentius ira:<br>'nunc morere. ast de me diuum pater atque hominum rex<br>uiderit.' hoc dicens eduxit corpore telum.<br>olli dura quies oculos et ferreus urget<br>somnus, in aeternam clauduntur lumina noctem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Caedicus slays Alcathoüs, Sacrator Hydaspes, Rapo Parthenius and the grim strength of Orses, Messapus Clonius and Erichaetes son of Lycaon, the one when his reinless horse stumbling had flung him to the ground, the other as they met on foot.

Aeneas, espying him in the deep columns, makes on to meet him. He remains, unterrified, awaiting his noble foe, steady in his own bulk, and measures with his eye the fair range for a spear. "This right hand's divinity, and the weapon I poise and hurl, now be favourable! thee, Lausus, I vow for the live trophy of Aeneas, dressed in the spoils stripped from the pirate's body." He ends, and throws the spear whistling from far; it flies on, glancing from the shield, and pierces illustrious Antores hard by him sidelong in the flank; Antores, companion of Hercules, who, sent thither from Argos, had stayed by Evander, and settled in an Italian town. Hapless he goes down with a wound not his own, and in death gazes on the sky, and Argos is sweet in his remembrance. Then good Aeneas throws his spear; through the sheltering circle of threefold brass, through the canvas lining and fabric of triple-sewn bull-hide it went, and sank deep in his groin; yet carried not its strength home. Quickly Aeneas, joyful at the sight of the Tyrrhenian's blood, snatches his sword from his thigh and presses hotly on his struggling enemy. Lausus saw, and groaned deeply for love of his dear father, and tears rolled over his face. Here will I not keep silence of thy hard death-doom and thine excellent deeds (if in any wise things wrought in the old time may win belief), nor of thyself, O fitly remembered! He, helpless and trammelled, withdrew backward, the deadly spear-shaft trailing from his shield. The youth broke forward and plunged into the fight; and even as Aeneas' hand rose to bring down the blow, he caught up his point and held him in delay. His comrades follow up with loud cries, so the father may withdraw in shelter of his son's shield, while they shower their darts and bear back the enemy with missiles from a distance. Aeneas wrathfully keeps covered. And as when storm-clouds pour down in streaming hail, all the ploughmen and country-folk scatter off the fields, and the wayfarer cowers safe in his fortress, a stream's bank or deep arch of rock, while the rain falls, that they may do their day's labour when sunlight reappears; thus under the circling storm of weapons Aeneas sustains the cloud of war till it thunders itself all away, and calls on Lausus, on Lausus, with chiding and menace: "Whither runnest thou on thy death, with daring beyond thy strength? thine affection betrays thee into rashness." But none the less he leaps madly on; and now wrath rises higher and fiercer in the Dardanian captain, and the Fates pass Lausus' last threads through their hand; for Aeneas drives the sword strongly right through him up all its length: the point pierced the light shield that armed his assailant, and the tunic sewn by his mother with flexible gold: blood filled his breast, and the life left the body and passed mourning through the air to the under world. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At uero ingentem quatiens Mezentius hastam<br>turbidus ingreditur campo. quam magnus Orion,<br>cum pedes incedit medii per maxima Nerei<br>stagna uiam scindens, umero supereminet undas,<br>aut summis referens annosam montibus ornum<br>ingrediturque solo et caput inter nubila condit,<br>talis se uastis infert Mezentius armis.<br>huic contra Aeneas speculatus in agmine longo<br>obuius ire parat. manet imperterritus ille<br>hostem magnanimum opperiens, et mole sua stat;<br>atque oculis spatium emensus quantum satis hastae:<br>'dextra mihi deus et telum, quod missile libro,<br>nunc adsint! uoueo praedonis corpore raptis<br>indutum spoliis ipsum te, Lause, tropaeum<br>Aeneae.' dixit, stridentemque eminus hastam<br>iecit. at illa uolans clipeo est excussa proculque<br>egregium Antoren latus inter et ilia figit,<br>Herculis Antoren comitem, qui missus ab Argis<br>haeserat Euandro atque Itala consederat urbe.<br>sternitur infelix alieno uulnere, caelumque<br>aspicit et dulcis moriens reminiscitur Argos.<br>tum pius Aeneas hastam iacit; illa per orbem<br>aere cauum triplici, per linea terga tribusque<br>transiit intextum tauris opus, imaque sedit<br>inguine, sed uiris haud pertulit. ocius ensem<br>Aeneas uiso Tyrrheni sanguine laetus<br>eripit a femine et trepidanti feruidus instat.<br>ingemuit cari grauiter genitoris amore,<br>ut uidit, Lausus, lacrimaeque per ora uolutae—<br>hic mortis durae casum tuaque optima facta,<br>si qua fidem tanto est operi latura uetustas,<br>non equidem nec te, iuuenis memorande, silebo—<br>ille pedem referens et inutilis inque ligatus<br>cedebat clipeoque inimicum hastile trahebat.<br>proripuit iuuenis seseque immiscuit armis,<br>iamque adsurgentis dextra plagamque ferentis<br>Aeneae subiit mucronem ipsumque morando<br>sustinuit; socii magno clamore sequuntur,<br>dum genitor nati parma protectus abiret,<br>telaque coniciunt perturbantque eminus hostem<br>missilibus. furit Aeneas tectusque tenet se.<br>ac uelut effusa si quando grandine nimbi<br>praecipitant, omnis campis diffugit arator<br>omnis et agricola, et tuta latet arce uiator<br>aut amnis ripis aut alti fornice saxi,<br>dum pluit in terris, ut possint sole reducto<br>exercere diem: sic obrutus undique telis<br>Aeneas nubem belli, dum detonet omnis,<br>sustinet et Lausum increpitat Lausoque minatur:<br>'quo moriture ruis maioraque uiribus audes?<br>fallit te incautum pietas tua.' nec minus ille<br>exsultat demens, saeuae iamque altius irae<br>Dardanio surgunt ductori, extremaque Lauso<br>Parcae fila legunt. ualidum namque exigit ensem<br>per medium Aeneas iuuenem totumque recondit;<br>transiit et parmam mucro, leuia arma minacis,<br>et tunicam molli mater quam neuerat auro,<br>impleuitque sinum sanguis; tum uita per auras<br>concessit maesta ad Manis corpusque reliquit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But when Anchises' son saw the look on the dying face, the face pale in wonderful wise, he sighed deeply in pity, and reached forth his hand, as the likeness of his own filial affection flashed across his soul. "What now shall good Aeneas give thee, what, O poor boy, for this thy praise, for guerdon of a nature so noble? Keep for thine own the armour thou didst delight in; and I restore thee, if that matters aught at all, to the ghosts and ashes of thy parents. Yet thou shalt have this sad comfort in thy piteous death, thou fallest by great Aeneas' hand." Then, chiding his hesitating comrades, he lifts him from the ground, dabbling the comely-ranged tresses with blood. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At uero ut uultum uidit morientis et ora,<br>ora modis Anchisiades pallentia miris,<br>ingemuit miserans grauiter dextramque tetendit,<br>et mentem patriae subiit pietatis imago.<br>'quid tibi nunc, miserande puer, pro laudibus istis,<br>quid pius Aeneas tanta dabit indole dignum?<br>arma, quibus laetatus, habe tua; teque parentum<br>manibus et cineri, si qua est ea cura, remitto.<br>hoc tamen infelix miseram solabere mortem:<br>Aeneae magni dextra cadis.' increpat ultro<br>cunctantis socios et terra subleuat ipsum<br>sanguine turpantem comptos de more capillos.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile his father, by the wave of the Tiber river, stanched his wound with water, and rested his body against a tree-trunk. Hard by his brazen helmet hangs from the boughs, and the heavy armour lies quietly on the meadow. Chosen men stand round; he, sick and panting, leans his neck and lets his beard spread down over his chest. Many a time he asks for Lausus, and sends many an one to call him back and carry a parent's sad commands. But Lausus his weeping comrades were bearing lifeless on his armour, mighty and mightily wounded to death. Afar the soul prophetic of ill knew their lamentation: he soils his gray hairs plenteously with dust, and stretches both hands on high, and clings on the dead. "Was life's hold on me so sweet, O my son, that I let him I bore receive the hostile stroke in my room? Am I, thy father, saved by these wounds of thine, and living by thy death? Alas and woe! now at last exile is bitter! now the wound is driven deep! And I, even I, O my son, stained thy name with crime, driven in hatred from the throne and sceptre of my fathers. I owed vengeance to my country and my people's resentment; might mine own guilty life but have paid it by every form of death! Now I live, and leave not yet man and day; but I will." As he speaks thus he raises himself painfully on his thigh, and though the violence of the deep wound cripples him, yet unbroken he bids his horse be brought, his beauty, his comfort, that ever had carried him victorious out of war, and says these words to the grieving beast: "Rhoebus, we have lived long, if aught at all lasts long with mortals. This day wilt thou either bring back in triumph the gory head and spoils of Aeneas, and we will avenge Lausus' agonies; or if no force opens a way, thou wilt die with me: for I deem not, bravest, thou wilt deign to bear an alien rule and a Teucrian lord." He spoke, and took his welcome seat on the back he knew, loading both hands with keen javelins, his head sheathed in glittering brass and shaggy horse-hair plumes. Thus he galloped in. Through his heart sweep together the vast tides of shame and mingling madness and grief. And with that he thrice loudly calls Aeneas. Aeneas knew the call, and makes glad invocation: "So the father of gods speed me, so Apollo on high: do thou essay to close hand to hand…" Thus much he utters, and moves up to meet him with levelled spear. And he: "Why seek to frighten me, fierce man, now my son is gone? this was thy one road to my ruin. We shrink not from death, nor relent before any of thy gods. Cease; for I come to my death, first carrying these gifts for thee." He spoke, and hurled a weapon at his enemy; then plants another and yet another as he darts round in a wide circle; but they are stayed on the boss of gold. Thrice he rode wheeling close round him by the left, and sent his weapons strongly in; thrice the Trojan hero turns round, taking the grim forest on his brazen guard. Then, weary of lingering in delay on delay, and plucking out spear-head after spear-head, and hard pressed in the uneven match of battle, with much counselling of spirit now at last he bursts forth, and sends his spear at the war-horse between the hollows of the temples. The creature raises itself erect, beating the air with its feet, throws its rider, and coming down after him in an entangled mass, slips its shoulder as it tumbles forward. The cries of Trojans and Latins kindle the sky. Aeneas rushes up, drawing his sword from the scabbard, and thus above him: "Where now is gallant Mezentius and all his fierce spirit?" Thereto the Tyrrhenian, as he came to himself and gazing up drank the air of heaven: "Bitter foe, why these taunts and menaces of death? Naught forbids my slaughter; neither on such terms came I to battle, nor did my Lausus make treaty for this between me and thee. This one thing I beseech thee, by whatsoever grace a vanquished enemy may claim: allow my body sepulture. I know I am girt by the bitter hatred of my people. Stay, I implore, their fury, and grant me and my son union in the tomb." So speaks he, and takes the sword in his throat unfalteringly, and the lifeblood spreads in a wave over his armour. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea genitor Tiberini ad fluminis undam<br>uulnera siccabat lymphis corpusque leuabat<br>arboris acclinis trunco. procul aerea ramis<br>dependet galea et prato grauia arma quiescunt.<br>stant lecti circum iuuenes; ipse aeger anhelans<br>colla fouet fusus propexam in pectore barbam;<br>multa super Lauso rogitat, multumque remittit<br>qui reuocent maestique ferant mandata parentis.<br>at Lausum socii exanimem super arma ferebant<br>flentes, ingentem atque ingenti uulnere uictum.<br>agnouit longe gemitum praesaga mali mens.<br>canitiem multo deformat puluere et ambas<br>ad caelum tendit palmas et corpore inhaeret.<br>'tantane me tenuit uiuendi, nate, uoluptas,<br>ut pro me hostili paterer succedere dextrae,<br>quem genui? tuane haec genitor per uulnera seruor<br>morte tua uiuens? heu, nunc misero mihi demum<br>exitium infelix, nunc alte uulnus adactum!<br>idem ego, nate, tuum maculaui crimine nomen,<br>pulsus ob inuidiam solio sceptrisque paternis.<br>debueram patriae poenas odiisque meorum:<br>omnis per mortis animam sontem ipse dedissem!<br>nunc uiuo neque adhuc homines lucemque relinquo.<br>sed linquam.' simul hoc dicens attollit in aegrum<br>se femur et, quamquam uis alto uulnere tardat,<br>haud deiectus equum duci iubet. hoc decus illi,<br>hoc solamen erat, bellis hoc uictor abibat<br>omnibus. adloquitur maerentem et talibus infit:<br>'Rhaebe, diu, res si qua diu mortalibus ulla est,<br>uiximus. aut hodie uictor spolia illa cruenti<br>et caput Aeneae referes Lausique dolorum<br>ultor eris mecum, aut, aperit si nulla uiam uis,<br>occumbes pariter; neque enim, fortissime, credo,<br>iussa aliena pati et dominos dignabere Teucros.'<br>dixit, et exceptus tergo consueta locauit<br>membra manusque ambas iaculis onerauit acutis,<br>aere caput fulgens cristaque hirsutus equina.<br>sic cursum in medios rapidus dedit. aestuat ingens<br>uno in corde pudor mixtoque insania luctu.<br>atque hic Aenean magna ter uoce uocauit.<br>Aeneas agnouit enim laetusque precatur:<br>'sic pater ille deum faciat, sic altus Apollo!<br>incipias conferre manum.'<br>tantum effatus et infesta subit obuius hasta.<br>ille autem: 'quid me erepto, saeuissime, nato<br>terres? haec uia sola fuit qua perdere posses:<br>nec mortem horremus nec diuum parcimus ulli.<br>desine, nam uenio moriturus et haec tibi porto<br>dona prius.' dixit, telumque intorsit in hostem;<br>inde aliud super atque aliud figitque uolatque<br>ingenti gyro, sed sustinet aureus umbo.<br>ter circum astantem laeuos equitauit in orbis<br>tela manu iaciens, ter secum Troius heros<br>immanem aerato circumfert tegmine siluam.<br>inde ubi tot traxisse moras, tot spicula taedet<br>uellere, et urgetur pugna congressus iniqua,<br>multa mouens animo iam tandem erumpit et inter<br>bellatoris equi caua tempora conicit hastam.<br>tollit se arrectum quadripes et calcibus auras<br>uerberat, effusumque equitem super ipse secutus<br>implicat eiectoque incumbit cernuus armo.<br>clamore incendunt caelum Troesque Latinique.<br>aduolat Aeneas uaginaque eripit ensem<br>et super haec: 'ubi nunc Mezentius acer et illa<br>effera uis animi?' contra Tyrrhenus, ut auras<br>suspiciens hausit caelum mentemque recepit:<br>'hostis amare, quid increpitas mortemque minaris?<br>nullum in caede nefas, nec sic ad proelia ueni,<br>nec tecum meus haec pepigit mihi foedera Lausus.<br>unum hoc per si qua est uictis uenia hostibus oro:<br>corpus humo patiare tegi. scio acerba meorum<br>circumstare odia: hunc, oro, defende furorem<br>et me consortem nati concede sepulcro.'<br>haec loquitur, iuguloque haud inscius accipit ensem<br>undantique animam diffundit in arma cruore.</rtc></ruby></p><nav><a href="#!/aeneid/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/aeneid/book9/" rel="prev">Previous</a> <a href="#!/aeneid/book11/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><small>Translated by <u>J.
