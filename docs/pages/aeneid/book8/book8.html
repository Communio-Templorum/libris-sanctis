Their chiefs, Messapus, and Ufens, and Mezentius, scorner of the gods, begin to enrol forces on all sides, and dispeople the wide fields of husbandmen. Venulus too is sent to the town of mighty Diomede to seek succour, to instruct him that Teucrians set foot in Latium; that Aeneas in his fleet invades them with the vanquished gods of his home, and proclaims himself the King summoned of fate; that many tribes join the Dardanian, and his name swells high in Latium. What he will rear on these foundations, what issue of battle he desires, if Fortune attend him, lies clearer to his own sight than to King Turnus or King Latinus. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vt belli signum Laurenti Turnus ab arce<br>extulit et rauco strepuerunt cornua cantu,<br>utque acris concussit equos utque impulit arma,<br>extemplo turbati animi, simul omne tumultu<br>coniurat trepido Latium saeuitque iuuentus<br>effera. ductores primi Messapus et Vfens<br>contemptorque deum Mezentius undique cogunt<br>auxilia et latos uastant cultoribus agros.<br>mittitur et magni Venulus Diomedis ad urbem<br>qui petat auxilium, et Latio consistere Teucros,<br>aduectum Aenean classi uictosque penatis<br>inferre et fatis regem se dicere posci<br>edoceat, multasque uiro se adiungere gentis<br>Dardanio et late Latio increbrescere nomen:<br>quid struat his coeptis, quem, si fortuna sequatur,<br>euentum pugnae cupiat, manifestius ipsi<br>quam Turno regi aut regi apparere Latino.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus was it in Latium. And the hero of Laomedon's blood, seeing it all, tosses on a heavy surge of care, and throws his mind rapidly this way and that, and turns it on all hands in swift change of thought: even as when the quivering light of water brimming in brass, struck back from the sunlight or the moon's glittering reflection, flickers abroad over all the room, and now mounts aloft and strikes the high panelled roof. Night fell, and over all lands weary creatures were fast in deep slumber, the race of fowl and of cattle; when lord Aeneas, sick at heart of the dismal warfare, stretched him on the river bank under the cope of the cold sky, and let sleep, though late, overspread his limbs. To him the very god of the ground, the pleasant Tiber stream, seemed to raise his aged form among the poplar boughs; thin lawn veiled him with its gray covering, and shadowy reeds hid his hair. Thereon he addressed him thus, and with these words allayed his distresses: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia per Latium. quae Laomedontius heros<br>cuncta uidens magno curarum fluctuat aestu,<br>atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc diuidit illuc<br>in partisque rapit uarias perque omnia uersat,<br>sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen aenis<br>sole repercussum aut radiantis imagine lunae<br>omnia peruolitat late loca, iamque sub auras<br>erigitur summique ferit laquearia tecti.<br>nox erat et terras animalia fessa per omnis<br>alituum pecudumque genus sopor altus habebat,<br>cum pater in ripa gelidique sub aetheris axe<br>Aeneas, tristi turbatus pectora bello,<br>procubuit seramque dedit per membra quietem.<br>huic deus ipse loci fluuio Tiberinus amoeno<br>populeas inter senior se attollere frondes<br>uisus (eum tenuis glauco uelabat amictu<br>carbasus, et crinis umbrosa tegebat harundo),<br>tum sic adfari et curas his demere dictis:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"O born of the family of the gods, thou who bearest back our Trojan city from hostile hands, and keepest Troy towers in eternal life; O long looked for on Laurentine ground and Latin fields! here is thine assured home, thine home's assured gods. Draw not thou back, nor be alarmed by menace of war. All the anger and wrath of the gods is passed away … And even now for thine assurance, that thou think not this the idle fashioning of sleep, a great sow shall be found lying under the oaks on the shore, with her new-born litter of thirty head: white she couches on the ground, and the brood about her teats is white. By this token in thirty revolving years shall Ascanius found a city, Alba of bright name. My prophecy is sure. Now hearken, and I will briefly instruct thee how thou mayest unravel and overcome thy present task. An Arcadian people sprung of Pallas, following in their king Evander's company beneath his banners, have chosen a place in these coasts, and set a city on the hills, called Pallanteum after Pallas their forefather. These wage perpetual war with the Latin race; these do thou take to thy camp's alliance, and join with them in league. Myself I will lead thee by my banks and straight along my stream, that thou mayest oar thy way upward against the river. Up and arise, goddess-born, and even with the setting stars address thy prayers to Juno as is meet, and vanquish her wrath and menaces with humble vows. To me thou shalt pay a conqueror's sacrifice. I am he whom thou seest washing the banks with full flood and severing the rich tilth, glassy Tiber, best beloved by heaven of rivers. Here is my stately home; my fountain-head is among high cities." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'O sate gente deum, Troianam ex hostibus urbem<br>qui reuehis nobis aeternaque Pergama seruas,<br>exspectate solo Laurenti aruisque Latinis,<br>hic tibi certa domus, certi (ne absiste) penates.<br>neu belli terrere minis; tumor omnis et irae<br>concessere deum.<br>iamque tibi, ne uana putes haec fingere somnum,<br>litoreis ingens inuenta sub ilicibus sus<br>triginta capitum fetus enixa iacebit,<br>alba solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati.<br>[hic locus urbis erit, requies ea certa laborum,]<br>ex quo ter denis urbem redeuntibus annis<br>Ascanius clari condet cognominis Albam.<br>haud incerta cano. nunc qua ratione quod instat<br>expedias uictor, paucis (aduerte) docebo.<br>Arcades his oris, genus a Pallante profectum,<br>qui regem Euandrum comites, qui signa secuti,<br>delegere locum et posuere in montibus urbem<br>Pallantis proaui de nomine Pallanteum.<br>hi bellum adsidue ducunt cum gente Latina;<br>hos castris adhibe socios et foedera iunge.<br>ipse ego te ripis et recto flumine ducam,<br>aduersum remis superes subuectus ut amnem.<br>surge age, nate dea, primisque cadentibus astris<br>Iunoni fer rite preces, iramque minasque<br>supplicibus supera uotis. mihi uictor honorem<br>persolues. ego sum pleno quem flumine cernis<br>stringentem ripas et pinguia culta secantem,<br>caeruleus Thybris, caelo gratissimus amnis.<br>hic mihi magna domus, celsis caput urbibus exit.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus spoke the River, and sank in the depth of the pool: night and sleep left Aeneas. He arises, and, looking towards the radiant sky of the sunrising, holds up water from the river in fitly-hollowed palms, and pours to heaven these accents: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Dixit, deinde lacu fluuius se condidit alto<br>ima petens; nox Aenean somnusque reliquit.<br>surgit et aetherii spectans orientia solis<br>lumina rite cauis undam de flumine palmis<br>sustinet ac talis effundit ad aethera uoces:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Nymphs, Laurentine Nymphs, from whom is the generation of rivers, and thou, O father Tiber, with thine holy flood, receive Aeneas and deign to save him out of danger. What pool soever holds thy source, who pitiest our discomforts, from whatsoever soil thou dost spring excellent in beauty, ever shall my worship, ever my gifts frequent thee, the hornèd river lord of Hesperian waters. Ah, be thou only by me, and graciously confirm thy will." So speaks he, and chooses two galleys from his fleet, and mans them with rowers, and withal equips a crew with arms. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Nymphae, Laurentes Nymphae, genus amnibus unde est,<br>tuque, o Thybri tuo genitor cum flumine sancto,<br>accipite Aenean et tandem arcete periclis.<br>quo te cumque lacus miserantem incommoda nostra<br>fonte tenent, quocumque solo pulcherrimus exis,<br>semper honore meo, semper celebrabere donis<br>corniger Hesperidum fluuius regnator aquarum.<br>adsis o tantum et propius tua numina firmes.'<br>sic memorat, geminasque legit de classe biremis<br>remigioque aptat, socios simul instruit armis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And lo! suddenly, ominous and wonderful to tell, the milk-white sow, of one colour with her white brood, is espied through the forest couched on the green brink; whom to thee, yes to thee, queenly Juno, good Aeneas offers in sacrifice, and sets with her offspring before thine altar. All that night long Tiber assuaged his swelling stream, and silently stayed his refluent wave, smoothing the surface of his waters to the fashion of still pool and quiet mere, to spare labour to the oar. So they set out and speed on their way with prosperous cries; the painted fir slides along the waterway; the waves and unwonted woods marvel at their far-gleaming shields, and the gay hulls afloat on the river. They outwear a night and a day in rowing, ascend the long reaches, and pass under the chequered shadows of the trees, and cut through the green woodland in the calm water. The fiery sun had climbed midway in the circle of the sky when they see afar fortress walls and scattered house roofs, where now the might of Rome hath risen high as heaven; then Evander held a slender state. Quickly they turn their prows to land and draw near the town. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ecce autem subitum atque oculis mirabile monstrum,<br>candida per siluam cum fetu concolor albo<br>procubuit uiridique in litore conspicitur sus;<br>quam pius Aeneas tibi enim, tibi, maxima Iuno,<br>mactat sacra ferens et cum grege sistit ad aram.<br>Thybris ea fluuium, quam longa est, nocte tumentem<br>leniit, et tacita refluens ita substitit unda,<br>mitis ut in morem stagni placidaeque paludis<br>sterneret aequor aquis, remo ut luctamen abesset.<br>ergo iter inceptum celerant rumore secundo:<br>labitur uncta uadis abies; mirantur et undae,<br>miratur nemus insuetum fulgentia longe<br>scuta uirum fluuio pictasque innare carinas.<br>olli remigio noctemque diemque fatigant<br>et longos superant flexus, uariisque teguntur<br>arboribus, uiridisque secant placido aequore siluas.<br>sol medium caeli conscenderat igneus orbem<br>cum muros arcemque procul ac rara domorum<br>tecta uident, quae nunc Romana potentia caelo<br>aequauit, tum res inopes Euandrus habebat.<br>ocius aduertunt proras urbique propinquant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>It chanced on that day the Arcadian king paid his accustomed sacrifice to the great son of Amphitryon and all the gods in a grove before the city. With him his son Pallas, with him all the chief of his people and his poor senate were offering incense, and the blood steamed warm at their altars. When they saw the high ships, saw them glide up between the shady woodlands and rest on their silent oars, the sudden sight appals them, and all at once they rise and stop the banquet. Pallas courageously forbids them to break off the rites; snatching up a spear, he flies forward, and from a hillock cries afar: "O men, what cause hath driven you to explore these unknown ways? or whither do you steer? What is your kin, whence your habitation? Is it peace or arms you carry hither?" Then from the lofty stern lord Aeneas thus speaks, stretching forth in his hand an olive bough of peace-bearing: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Forte die sollemnem illo rex Arcas honorem<br>Amphitryoniadae magno diuisque ferebat<br>ante urbem in luco.

"Descend," he cries, "whoso thou art, and speak with my father face to face, and enter our home and hospitality." And giving him the grasp of welcome, he caught and clung to his hand. Advancing, they enter the grove and leave the river. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">obstipuit tanto percussus nomine Pallas:<br>'egredere o quicumque es' ait 'coramque parentem<br>adloquere ac nostris succede penatibus hospes.'<br>excepitque manu dextramque amplexus inhaesit;<br>progressi subeunt luco fluuiumque relinquunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then Aeneas in courteous words addresses the King: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum regem Aeneas dictis adfatur amicis:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Best of the Grecian race, thou whom fortune hath willed that I supplicate, holding before me boughs dressed in fillets, no fear stayed me because thou wert a Grecian chief and an Arcadian, or allied by descent to the twin sons of Atreus. Nay, mine own prowess and the sanctity of divine oracles, our ancestral kinship, and the fame of thee that is spread abroad over the earth, have allied me to thee and led me willingly on the path of fate. Dardanus, who sailed to the Teucrian land, the first father and founder of the Ilian city, was born, as Greeks relate, of Electra the Atlantid; Electra's sire is ancient Atlas, whose shoulder sustains the heavenly spheres. Your father is Mercury, whom white Maia conceived and bore on the cold summit of Cyllene; but Maia, if we give any credence to report, is daughter of Atlas, that same Atlas who bears up the starry heavens; so both our families branch from a single blood. In this confidence I sent no embassy, I framed no crafty overtures; myself I have presented mine own person, and come a suppliant to thy courts. The same Daunian race pursues us and thee in merciless warfare; we once expelled, they trust nothing will withhold them from laying all Hesperia wholly beneath their yoke, and holding the seas that wash it above and below. Accept and return our friendship. We can give brave hearts in war, high souls and men approved in deeds." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'optime Graiugenum, cui me Fortuna precari<br>et uitta comptos uoluit praetendere ramos,<br>non equidem extimui Danaum quod ductor et Arcas<br>quodque a stirpe fores geminis coniunctus Atridis;<br>sed mea me uirtus et sancta oracula diuum<br>cognatique patres, tua terris didita fama,<br>coniunxere tibi et fatis egere uolentem.<br>Dardanus, Iliacae primus pater urbis et auctor,<br>Electra, ut Grai perhibent, Atlantide cretus,<br>aduehitur Teucros; Electram maximus Atlas<br>edidit, aetherios umero qui sustinet orbis.<br>uobis Mercurius pater est, quem candida Maia<br>Cyllenae gelido conceptum uertice fudit;<br>at Maiam, auditis si quicquam credimus, Atlas,<br>idem Atlas generat caeli qui sidera tollit.<br>sic genus amborum scindit se sanguine ab uno.<br>his fretus non legatos neque prima per artem<br>temptamenta tui pepigi; me, me ipse meumque<br>obieci caput et supplex ad limina ueni.<br>gens eadem, quae te, crudeli Daunia bello<br>insequitur; nos si pellant nihil afore credunt<br>quin omnem Hesperiam penitus sua sub iuga mittant,<br>et mare quod supra teneant quodque adluit infra.<br>accipe daque fidem. sunt nobis fortia bello<br>pectora, sunt animi et rebus spectata iuuentus.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Aeneas ended.

For I remember how Priam son of Laomedon, when he sought Salamis on his way to the realm of his sister Hesione, went on to visit the cold borders of Arcadia. Then early youth clad my cheeks with bloom. I admired the Teucrian captains, admired their lord, the son of Laomedon; but Anchises moved high above them all. My heart burned with youthful passion to accost him and clasp hand in hand; I made my way to him, and led him eagerly to Pheneus' high town. Departing he gave me an adorned quiver and Lycian arrows, a scarf inwoven with gold, and a pair of golden bits that now my Pallas possesses. Therefore my hand is already joined in the alliance you seek, and soon as to-morrow's dawn rises again over earth, I will send you away rejoicing in mine aid, and supply you from my store. Meanwhile, since you are come hither in friendship, solemnise with us these yearly rites which we may not defer, and even now learn to be familiar at your comrades' board." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'ut te, fortissime Teucrum,<br>accipio agnoscoque libens! ut uerba parentis<br>et uocem Anchisae magni uultumque recordor!<br>nam memini Hesionae uisentem regna sororis<br>Laomedontiaden Priamum Salamina petentem<br>protinus Arcadiae gelidos inuisere finis.<br>tum mihi prima genas uestibat flore iuuentas,<br>mirabarque duces Teucros, mirabar et ipsum<br>Laomedontiaden; sed cunctis altior ibat<br>Anchises. mihi mens iuuenali ardebat amore<br>compellare uirum et dextrae coniungere dextram;<br>accessi et cupidus Phenei sub moenia duxi.<br>ille mihi insignem pharetram Lyciasque sagittas<br>discedens chlamydemque auro dedit intertextam,<br>frenaque bina meus quae nunc habet aurea Pallas.<br>ergo et quam petitis iuncta est mihi foedere dextra,<br>et lux cum primum terris se crastina reddet,<br>auxilio laetos dimittam opibusque iuuabo.<br>interea sacra haec, quando huc uenistis amici,<br>annua, quae differre nefas, celebrate fauentes<br>nobiscum, et iam nunc sociorum adsuescite mensis.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>This said, he commands the feast and the wine-cups to be replaced whence they were taken, and with his own hand ranges them on the grassy seat, and welcomes Aeneas to the place of honour, with a lion's shaggy fell for cushion and a hospitable chair of maple. Then chosen men with the priest of the altar in emulous haste bring roasted flesh of bulls, and pile baskets with the gift of ground corn, and serve the wine. Aeneas and the men of Troy with him feed on the long chines of oxen and the entrails of the sacrifice. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta, dapes iubet et sublata reponi<br>pocula gramineoque uiros locat ipse sedili,<br>praecipuumque toro et uillosi pelle leonis<br>accipit Aenean solioque inuitat acerno.<br>tum lecti iuuenes certatim araeque sacerdos<br>uiscera tosta ferunt taurorum, onerantque canistris<br>dona laboratae Cereris, Bacchumque ministrant.<br>uescitur Aeneas simul et Troiana iuuentus<br>perpetui tergo bouis et lustralibus extis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>After hunger is driven away and the desire of food stayed, King Evander speaks: "No idle superstition that knows not the gods of old hath ordered these our solemn rites, this customary feast, this altar of august sanctity; saved from bitter perils, O Trojan guest, do we worship, and most due are the rites we inaugurate. Look now first on this overhanging cliff of stone, where shattered masses lie strewn, and the mountain dwelling stands desolate, and rocks are rent away in vast ruin. Here was a cavern, awful and deep-withdrawn, impenetrable to the sunbeams, where the monstrous half-human shape of Cacus had his hold: the ground was ever wet with fresh slaughter, and pallid faces of men, ghastly with gore, hung nailed on the haughty doors. This monster was the son of Vulcan, and spouted his black fires from his mouth as he moved in giant bulk. To us also in our desire time bore a god's aid and arrival. For princely Alcides the avenger came glorious in the spoils of triple Geryon slain; this way the Conqueror drove the huge bulls, and his oxen filled the river valley. But savage Cacus, infatuate to leave nothing undared or unhandled in craft or crime, drives four bulls of choice shape away from their pasturage, and as many heifers of excellent beauty. And these, that there should be no straightforward footprints, he dragged by the tail into his cavern, the track of their compelled path reversed, and hid them behind the screen of rock. No marks were there to lead a seeker to the cavern. Meanwhile the son of Amphitryon, his herds filled with food, was now breaking up his pasturage and making ready to go. The oxen low as they depart; all the woodland is filled with their complaint as they clamorously quit the hills. One heifer returned the cry, and, lowing from the depth of the dreary cave, baffled the hope of Cacus from her imprisonment. At this the grief and choler of Alcides blazed forth dark and infuriate. Seizing in his hand his club of heavy knotted oak, he seeks with swift pace the aery mountain steep. Then, as never before, did we see Cacus afraid and his countenance troubled; he goes flying swifter than the wind and seeks his cavern; fear wings his feet. As he shut himself in, and, bursting the chains, dropped the vast rock slung in iron by his father's craft, and blocked the doorway with its pressure, lo! the Tirynthian came in furious wrath, and, scanning all the entry, turned his face this way and that and ground his teeth. Thrice, hot with rage, he circles all Mount Aventine; thrice he assails the rocky portals in vain; thrice he sinks down outwearied in the valley. There stood a sharp rock of flint with sides cut sheer away, rising over the cavern's ridge a vast height to see, fit haunt for foul birds to build on. This—for, sloping from the ridge, it leaned on the left towards the river—he loosened, urging it from the right till he tore it loose from its deep foundations; then suddenly shook it free; with the shock the vast sky thunders, the banks leap apart, and the amazed river recoils. But the den, Cacus' huge palace, lay open and revealed, and the depths of gloomy cavern were made manifest; even as though some force tearing earth apart should unlock the infernal house, and disclose the pallid realms abhorred of heaven, and deep down the monstrous gulf be descried where the ghosts flutter in the streaming daylight. On him then, surprised in unexpected light, shut in the rock's recesses and howling in strange fashion, Alcides from above hurls missiles and calls all his arms to aid, and presses hard on him with boughs and enormous millstones. And he, for none other escape from peril is left, vomits from his throat vast jets of smoke, wonderful to tell, and enwreathes his dwelling in blind gloom, blotting view from the eyes, while in the cave's depth night thickens with smoke-bursts in a darkness shot with fire. Alcides broke forth in anger, and with a bound hurled himself sheer amid the flames, where the smoke rolls billowing and voluminous, and the cloud surges black through the enormous den. Here, as Cacus in the darkness spouts forth his idle fires, he grasps and twines tight round him, till his eyes start out and his throat is drained of blood under the strangling pressure. Straightway the doors are torn open and the dark house laid plain; the stolen oxen and forsworn plunder are shewn forth to heaven, and the misshapen carcase dragged forward by the feet. Men cannot satisfy their soul with gazing on the terrible eyes, the monstrous face and shaggy bristling chest, and the throat with its quenched fires. Thenceforth this sacrifice is solemnised, and a younger race have gladly kept the day; Potitius the inaugurator, and the Pinarian family, guardians of the rites of Hercules, have set in the grove this altar, which shall ever be called of us Most Mighty, and shall be our mightiest evermore.

They renew the banquet, and bring the grateful gift of a second repast, and heap the altars with loaded platters. Then the Salii stand round the lit altar-fires to sing, their brows bound with poplar boughs, one chorus of young men, one of elders, and extol in song the praises and deeds of Hercules; how first he strangled in his gripe the twin terrors, the snakes of his stepmother; how he likewise shattered in war famous cities, Troy and Oechalia; how under Eurystheus the King he bore the toil of a thousand labours by Juno's malign decrees. Thine hand, unconquered, slays the cloud-born double-bodied race, Hylaeus and Pholus, the Cretan monster, and the huge lion in the hollow Nemean rock. Before thee the Stygian pools shook for fear, before thee the warder of hell, couched on half-gnawn bones in his blood-stained cavern; to thee not any form was terrible, not Typhoeus' self towering in arms; thou wast not bereft of counsel when the snake of Lerna encompassed thee with thronging heads. Hail, true seed of Jove, deified glory! graciously visit us and these thy rites with favourable feet.

The age-worn King walked holding Aeneas and his son by his side for companions on his way, and lightened the road with changing talk. Aeneas admires and turns his eyes lightly round about, pleased with the country; and gladly on spot after spot inquires and hears of the memorials of earlier men.

Long ago Saturn came from heaven on high in flight before Jove's arms, an exile from his lost realm. He gathered together the unruly race scattered on the mountain heights, and gave them statutes, and chose Latium to be their name, since in these borders he had found a safe hiding-place. Beneath his reign were the ages named of gold; thus, in peace and quietness, did he rule the nations; till gradually there crept in a sunken and stained time, the rage of war, and the lust of possession. Then came the Ausonian clan and the tribes of Sicania, and many a time the land of Saturn put away her name. Then were kings, and fierce Thybris with his giant bulk, from whose name we of Italy afterwards called the Tiber river, when it lost the true name of old, Albula.

Next he points out the wide grove where valiant Romulus set his sanctuary, and the Lupercal in the cool hollow of the rock, dedicate to Lycean Pan after the manner of Parrhasia. Therewithal he shows the holy wood of Argiletum, and calls the spot to witness as he tells the slaying of his guest Argus. Hence he leads him to the Tarpeian house, and the Capitol golden now, of old rough with forest thickets. Even then men trembled before the wood and rock. "This grove," he cries, "this hill with its leafy crown, is a god's dwelling, though whose we know not; the Arcadians believe Jove himself hath been visible, when often he shook the darkening aegis in his hand and gathered the storm-clouds.

His consort knew, rejoiced in her wiles, and felt her beauty.

An island rises by the side of Sicily and Aeolian Lipare, steep with smoking cliffs, whereunder the vaulted and thunderous Aetnean caverns are hollowed out for Cyclopean forges, the strong strokes on the anvils echo in groans, ore of steel hisses in the vaults, and the fire pants in the furnaces: the house of Vulcan, and Vulcania the land's name. Hither now the Lord of Fire descends from heaven's height. In the vast cavern the Cyclopes were forging iron, Brontes and Steropes and Pyracmon with bared limbs. Shaped in their hands was a thunderbolt, in part already polished, such as the Father of Heaven hurls down on earth in multitudes, part yet unfinished. Three coils of frozen rain, three of watery mist they had enwrought in it, three of ruddy fire and winged south wind; now they were mingling in their work the awful splendours, the sound and terror, and the angry pursuing flames. Elsewhere they hurried on a chariot for Mars with flying wheels, wherewith he stirs up men and cities; and burnished the golden serpent-scales of the awful aegis, the armour of wrathful Pallas, and the entwined snakes on the breast of the goddess, the Gorgon head with severed neck and rolling eyes. "Away with all!" he cries: "stop your tasks unfinished, Cyclopes of Aetna, and attend to this; a warrior's armour must be made. Now must strength, now quickness of hand be tried, now all our art lend her guidance. Fling off delay." He spoke no more; but they all bent rapidly to the work, allotting their labours equally. Brass and ore of gold flow in streams, and wounding steel is molten in the vast furnace. They shape a mighty shield, to receive singly all the weapons of the Latins, and weld it sevenfold, circle on circle. Some fill and empty the windy bellows of their blast, some dip the hissing brass in the trough. They raise their arms mightily in responsive time, and turn the mass of metal about in the grasp of their tongs. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Inde ubi prima quies medio iam noctis abactae<br>curriculo expulerat somnum, cum femina primum,<br>cui tolerare colo uitam tenuique Minerua<br>impositum, cinerem et sopitos suscitat ignis<br>noctem addens operi, famulasque ad lumina longo<br>exercet penso, castum ut seruare cubile<br>coniugis et possit paruos educere natos:<br>haud secus ignipotens nec tempore segnior illo<br>mollibus e stratis opera ad fabrilia surgit.<br>insula Sicanium iuxta latus Aeoliamque<br>erigitur Liparen fumantibus ardua saxis,<br>quam subter specus et Cyclopum exesa caminis<br>antra Aetnaea tonant, ualidique incudibus ictus<br>auditi referunt gemitus, striduntque cauernis<br>stricturae Chalybum et fornacibus ignis anhelat,<br>Volcani domus et Volcania nomine tellus.<br>hoc tunc ignipotens caelo descendit ab alto.<br>ferrum exercebant uasto Cyclopes in antro,<br>Brontesque Steropesque et nudus membra Pyragmon.<br>his informatum manibus iam parte polita<br>fulmen erat, toto genitor quae plurima caelo<br>deicit in terras, pars imperfecta manebat.<br>tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae<br>addiderant, rutuli tris ignis et alitis Austri.<br>fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumque metumque<br>miscebant operi flammisque sequacibus iras.<br>parte alia Marti currumque rotasque uolucris<br>instabant, quibus ille uiros, quibus excitat urbes;<br>aegidaque horriferam, turbatae Palladis arma,<br>certatim squamis serpentum auroque polibant<br>conexosque anguis ipsamque in pectore diuae<br>Gorgona desecto uertentem lumina collo.<br>'tollite cuncta' inquit 'coeptosque auferte labores,<br>Aetnaei Cyclopes, et huc aduertite mentem:<br>arma acri facienda uiro. nunc uiribus usus,<br>nunc manibus rapidis, omni nunc arte magistra.<br>praecipitate moras.' nec plura effatus, at illi<br>ocius incubuere omnes pariterque laborem<br>sortiti. fluit aes riuis aurique metallum<br>uulnificusque chalybs uasta fornace liquescit.<br>ingentem clipeum informant, unum omnia contra<br>tela Latinorum, septenosque orbibus orbis<br>impediunt. alii uentosis follibus auras<br>accipiunt redduntque, alii stridentia tingunt<br>aera lacu; gemit impositis incudibus antrum;<br>illi inter sese multa ui bracchia tollunt<br>in numerum, uersantque tenaci forcipe massam.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>While the lord of Lemnos is busied thus in the borders of Aeolia, Evander is roused from his low dwelling by the gracious daylight and the matin songs of birds from the eaves. The old man arises, and draws on his body raiment, and ties the Tyrrhene shoe latchets about his feet; then buckles to his side and shoulder his Tegeaean sword, and swathes himself in a panther skin that droops upon his left. Therewithal two watch-dogs go before him from the high threshold, and accompany their master's steps. The hero sought his guest Aeneas in the privacy of his dwelling, mindful of their talk and his promised bounty. Nor did Aeneas fail to be astir with the dawn.

On this side the Tuscan river shuts us in; on that the Rutulian drives us hard, and thunders in arms about our walls. But I purpose to unite to thee mighty peoples and the camp of a wealthy realm; an unforeseen chance offers this for thy salvation. Fate summons thy approach. Not far from here stands fast Agylla city, an ancient pile of stone, where of old the Lydian race, eminent in war, settled on the Etruscan ridges. For many years it flourished, till King Mezentius ruled it with insolent sway and armed terror. Why should I relate the horrible murders, the savage deeds of the monarch? May the gods keep them in store for himself and his line! Nay, he would even link dead bodies to living, fitting hand to hand and face to face (the torture!), and in the oozy foulness and corruption of the dreadful embrace so slay them by a lingering death. But at last his citizens, outwearied by his mad excesses, surround him and his house in arms, cut down his comrades, and hurl fire on his roof. Amid the massacre he escaped to the refuge of Rutulian land and the armed defence of Turnus' friendship. So all Etruria hath risen in righteous fury, and in immediate battle claim their king for punishment. Over these thousands will I make thee chief, O Aeneas; for their noisy ships crowd all the shore, and they bid the standards advance, while the aged diviner stays them with prophecies: "O chosen men of Maeonia, flower and strength of them, of old time, whom righteous anger urges on the enemy, and Mezentius inflames with deserved wrath, to no Italian is it permitted to hold this great nation in control: choose foreigners to lead you." At that, terrified by the divine warning, the Etruscan lines have encamped on the plain; Tarchon himself hath sent ambassadors to me with the crown and sceptre of the kingdom, and offers the royal attire will I but enter their camp and take the Tyrrhene realm. But old age, frozen to dulness, and exhausted with length of life, denies me the load of empire, and my prowess is past its day. I would urge it on my son, did not the mixture of blood by his Sabellian mother make this half his native land. Thou, to whose years and race alike the fates extend their favour, on whom fortune calls, enter thou in, a leader supreme in bravery over Teucrians and Italians. Mine own Pallas likewise, our hope and comfort, I will send with thee; let him grow used to endure warfare and the stern work of battle under thy teaching, to regard thine actions, and from his earliest years look up to thee. To him will I give two hundred Arcadian cavalry, the choice of our warlike strength, and Pallas as many more to thee in his own name." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'maxime Teucrorum ductor, quo sospite numquam<br>res equidem Troiae uictas aut regna fatebor,<br>nobis ad belli auxilium pro nomine tanto<br>exiguae uires; hinc Tusco claudimur amni,<br>hinc Rutulus premit et murum circumsonat armis.<br>sed tibi ego ingentis populos opulentaque regnis<br>iungere castra paro, quam fors inopina salutem<br>ostentat: fatis huc te poscentibus adfers.<br>haud procul hinc saxo incolitur fundata uetusto<br>urbis Agyllinae sedes, ubi Lydia quondam<br>gens, bello praeclara, iugis insedit Etruscis.<br>hanc multos florentem annos rex deinde superbo<br>imperio et saeuis tenuit Mezentius armis.<br>quid memorem infandas caedes, quid facta tyranni<br>effera? di capiti ipsius generique reseruent!<br>mortua quin etiam iungebat corpora uiuis<br>componens manibusque manus atque oribus ora,<br>tormenti genus, et sanie taboque fluentis<br>complexu in misero longa sic morte necabat.<br>at fessi tandem ciues infanda furentem<br>armati circumsistunt ipsumque domumque,<br>obtruncant socios, ignem ad fastigia iactant.<br>ille inter caedem Rutulorum elapsus in agros<br>confugere et Turni defendier hospitis armis.<br>ergo omnis furiis surrexit Etruria iustis,<br>regem ad supplicium praesenti Marte reposcunt.<br>his ego te, Aenea, ductorem milibus addam.<br>toto namque fremunt condensae litore puppes<br>signaque ferre iubent, retinet longaeuus haruspex<br>fata canens: "o Maeoniae delecta iuuentus,<br>flos ueterum uirtusque uirum, quos iustus in hostem<br>fert dolor et merita accendit Mezentius ira,<br>nulli fas Italo tantam subiungere gentem:<br>externos optate duces." tum Etrusca resedit<br>hoc acies campo monitis exterrita diuum.<br>ipse oratores ad me regnique coronam<br>cum sceptro misit mandatque insignia Tarchon,<br>succedam castris Tyrrhenaque regna capessam.<br>sed mihi tarda gelu saeclisque effeta senectus<br>inuidet imperium seraeque ad fortia uires.<br>natum exhortarer, ni mixtus matre Sabella<br>hinc partem patriae traheret. tu, cuius et annis<br>et generi fatum indulget, quem numina poscunt,<br>ingredere, o Teucrum atque Italum fortissime ductor.<br>hunc tibi praeterea, spes et solacia nostri,<br>Pallanta adiungam; sub te tolerare magistro<br>militiam et graue Martis opus, tua cernere facta<br>adsuescat, primis et te miretur ab annis.<br>Arcadas huic equites bis centum, robora pubis<br>lecta dabo, totidemque suo tibi nomine Pallas.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Scarce had he ended; Aeneas, son of Anchises, and trusty Achates gazed with steadfast face, and, sad at heart, were revolving inly many a labour, had not the Cytherean sent a sign from the clear sky. For suddenly a flash and peal comes quivering from heaven, and all seemed in a moment to totter, and the Tyrrhene trumpet-blast to roar along the sky. They look up; again and yet again the heavy crash re-echoes. They see in the serene space of sky armour gleam red through a cloud in the clear air, and ring clashing out. The others stood in amaze; but the Trojan hero knew the sound for the promise of his goddess mother; then he speaks: "Ask not, O friend, ask not in any wise what fortune this presage announces; it is I who am summoned of heaven. This sign the goddess who bore me foretold she would send if war assailed, and would bring through the air to my succour armour from Vulcan's hands… Ah, what slaughter awaits the wretched Laurentines! what a price, O Turnus, wilt thou pay me! how many shields and helmets and brave bodies of men shalt thou, Lord Tiber, roll under thy waves! Let them call for armed array and break the league!" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vix ea fatus erat, defixique ora tenebant<br>Aeneas Anchisiades et fidus Achates,<br>multaque dura suo tristi cum corde putabant,<br>ni signum caelo Cytherea dedisset aperto.<br>namque improuiso uibratus ab aethere fulgor<br>cum sonitu uenit et ruere omnia uisa repente,<br>Tyrrhenusque tubae mugire per aethera clangor.<br>suspiciunt, iterum atque iterum fragor increpat ingens.<br>arma inter nubem caeli in regione serena<br>per sudum rutilare uident et pulsa tonare.<br>obstipuere animis alii, sed Troius heros<br>agnouit sonitum et diuae promissa parentis.<br>tum memorat: 'ne uero, hospes, ne quaere profecto<br>quem casum portenta ferant: ego poscor Olympo.<br>hoc signum cecinit missuram diua creatrix,<br>si bellum ingrueret, Volcaniaque arma per auras<br>laturam auxilio.<br>heu quantae miseris caedes Laurentibus instant!<br>quas poenas mihi, Turne, dabis! quam multa sub undas<br>scuta uirum galeasque et fortia corpora uolues,<br>Thybri pater! poscant acies et foedera rumpant.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>These words uttered, he rises from the high seat, and first wakes with fresh fire the slumbering altars of Hercules, and gladly draws nigh his tutelar god of yesternight and the small deities of the household. Alike Evander, and alike the men of Troy, offer up, as is right, choice sheep of two years old. Thereafter he goes to the ships and revisits his crew, of whose company he chooses the foremost in valour to attend him to war; the rest glide down the water and float idly with the descending stream, to come with news to Ascanius of his father's state. They give horses to the Teucrians who seek the fields of Tyrrhenia; a chosen one is brought for Aeneas, housed in a tawny lion skin that glitters with claws of gold. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta dedit, solio se tollit ab alto<br>et primum Herculeis sopitas ignibus aras<br>excitat, hesternumque larem paruosque penatis<br>laetus adit; mactat lectas de more bidentis<br>Euandrus pariter, pariter Troiana iuuentus.<br>post hinc ad nauis graditur sociosque reuisit,<br>quorum de numero qui sese in bella sequantur<br>praestantis uirtute legit; pars cetera prona<br>fertur aqua segnisque secundo defluit amni,<br>nuntia uentura Ascanio rerumque patrisque.<br>dantur equi Teucris Tyrrhena petentibus arua;<br>ducunt exsortem Aeneae, quem fulua leonis<br>pellis obit totum praefulgens unguibus aureis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Rumour flies suddenly, spreading over the little town, that they ride in haste to the courts of the Tyrrhene king. Mothers redouble their prayers in terror, as fear treads closer on peril and the likeness of the War God looms larger in sight. Then Evander, clasping the hand of his departing son, clings to him weeping inconsolably, and speaks thus: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Fama uolat paruam subito uulgata per urbem<br>ocius ire equites Tyrrheni ad limina regis.<br>uota metu duplicant matres, propiusque periclo<br>it timor et maior Martis iam apparet imago.<br>tum pater Euandrus dextram complexus euntis<br>haeret inexpletus lacrimans ac talia fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Oh, if Jupiter would restore me the years that are past, as I was when, close under Praeneste, I cut down their foremost ranks and burned the piled shields of the conquered! Then this right hand sent King Erulus down to hell, though to him at his birth his mother Feronia (awful to tell) had given three lives and triple arms to wield; thrice must he be laid low in death; yet then this hand took all his lives and as often stripped him of his arms. Never should I now, O son, be severed from thy dear embrace; never had the insolent sword of Mezentius on my borders dealt so many cruel deaths, widowed the city of so many citizens. But you, O heavenly powers, and thou, Jupiter, Lord and Governor of Heaven, have compassion, I pray, on the Arcadian king, and hear a father's prayers. If your deity and decrees keep my Pallas safe for me, if I live that I may see him and meet him yet, I pray for life; any toil soever I have patience to endure. But if, O Fortune, thou threatenest some dread calamity, now, ah now, may I break off a cruel life, while anxiety still wavers and expectation is in doubt, while thou, dear boy, my one last delight, art yet clasped in my embrace; let no bitterer message wound mine ear." These words the father poured forth at the final parting; his servants bore him swooning within. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'o mihi praeteritos referat si Iuppiter annos,<br>qualis eram cum primam aciem Praeneste sub ipsa<br>straui scutorumque incendi uictor aceruos<br>et regem hac Erulum dextra sub Tartara misi,<br>nascenti cui tris animas Feronia mater<br>(horrendum dictu) dederat, terna arma mouenda—<br>ter leto sternendus erat; cui tunc tamen omnis<br>abstulit haec animas dextra et totidem exuit armis:<br>non ego nunc dulci amplexu diuellerer usquam,<br>nate, tuo, neque finitimo Mezentius umquam<br>huic capiti insultans tot ferro saeua dedisset<br>funera, tam multis uiduasset ciuibus urbem.<br>at uos, o superi, et diuum tu maxime rector<br>Iuppiter, Arcadii, quaeso, miserescite regis<br>et patrias audite preces. si numina uestra<br>incolumem Pallanta mihi, si fata reseruant,<br>si uisurus eum uiuo et uenturus in unum,<br>uitam oro, patior quemuis durare laborem.<br>sin aliquem infandum casum, Fortuna, minaris,<br>nunc, nunc o liceat crudelem abrumpere uitam,<br>dum curae ambiguae, dum spes incerta futuri,<br>dum te, care puer, mea sola et sera uoluptas,<br>complexu teneo, grauior neu nuntius auris<br>uulneret.' haec genitor digressu dicta supremo<br>fundebat; famuli conlapsum in tecta ferebant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now the cavalry had issued from the open gates, Aeneas and trusty Achates among the foremost, then other of the Trojan princes, Pallas conspicuous amid the column in scarf and inlaid armour; like the Morning Star, when, newly washed in the ocean wave, he shews his holy face in heaven, and melts the darkness away. Fearful mothers stand on the walls and follow with their eyes the cloud of dust and the squadrons gleaming in brass. They, where the goal of their way lies nearest, bear through the brushwood in armed array. Forming in column, they advance noisily, and the horse hoof shakes the crumbling plain with four-footed trampling. There is a high grove by the cold river of Caere, widely revered in ancestral awe; sheltering hills shut it in all about and girdle the woodland with their dark firs. Rumour is that the old Pelasgians, who once long ago held the Latin borders, consecrated the grove and its festal day to Silvanus, god of the tilth and flock. Not far from it Tarchon and his Tyrrhenians were encamped in a protected place; and now from the hill-top the tents of all their army might be seen outspread on the fields. Lord Aeneas and his chosen warriors draw hither and refresh their weary horses and limbs. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque adeo exierat portis equitatus apertis<br>Aeneas inter primos et fidus Achates,<br>inde alii Troiae proceres; ipse agmine Pallas<br>it medio chlamyde et pictis conspectus in armis,<br>qualis ubi Oceani perfusus Lucifer unda,<br>quem Venus ante alios astrorum diligit ignis,<br>extulit os sacrum caelo tenebrasque resoluit.<br>stant pauidae in muris matres oculisque sequuntur<br>pulueream nubem et fulgentis aere cateruas.<br>olli per dumos, qua proxima meta uiarum,<br>armati tendunt; it clamor, et agmine facto<br>quadripedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.<br>est ingens gelidum lucus prope Caeritis amnem,<br>religione patrum late sacer; undique colles<br>inclusere caui et nigra nemus abiete cingunt.<br>Siluano fama est ueteres sacrasse Pelasgos,<br>aruorum pecorisque deo, lucumque diemque,<br>qui primi finis aliquando habuere Latinos.<br>haud procul hinc Tarcho et Tyrrheni tuta tenebant<br>castra locis, celsoque omnis de colle uideri<br>iam poterat legio et latis tendebat in aruis.<br>huc pater Aeneas et bello lecta iuuentus<br>succedunt, fessique et equos et corpora curant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But Venus the white goddess drew nigh, bearing her gifts through the clouds of heaven; and when she saw her son withdrawn far apart in the valley's recess by the cold river, cast herself in his way, and addressed him thus: "Behold perfected the presents of my husband's promised craftsmanship: so shalt thou not shun, O my child, soon to challenge the haughty Laurentines or fiery Turnus to battle." The Cytherean spoke, and sought her son's embrace, and laid the armour glittering under an oak over against him. He, rejoicing in the magnificence of the goddess' gift, cannot have his fill of turning his eyes over it piece by piece, and admires and handles between his arms the helmet, dread with plumes and spouting flame, as when a blue cloud takes fire in the sunbeams and gleams afar; then the smooth greaves of electrum and refined gold, the spear, and the shield's ineffable design. There the Lord of Fire had fashioned the story of Italy and the triumphs of the Romans, not witless of prophecy or ignorant of the age to be; there all the race of Ascanius' future seed, and their wars fought one by one. Likewise had he fashioned the she-wolf couched after the birth in the green cave of Mars; round her teats the twin boys hung playing, and fearlessly mouthed their foster-mother; she, with round neck bent back, stroked them by turns and shaped their bodies with her tongue. Thereto not far from this he had set Rome and the lawless rape of the Sabines in the concourse of the theatre when the great Circensian games were celebrated, and a fresh war suddenly arising between the people of Romulus and aged Tatius and austere Cures. Next these same kings laid down their mutual strife and stood armed before Jove's altar with cup in hand, and joined treaty over a slain sow. Not far from there four-horse chariots driven apart had torn Mettus asunder (but thou, O Alban, shouldst have kept by thy words!), and Tullus tore the flesh of the liar through the forest, his splashed blood dripping from the briars. Therewithal Porsena commanded to admit the exiled Tarquin, and held the city in the grasp of a strong blockade; the Aeneadae rushed on the sword for liberty. Him thou couldst espy like one who chafes and like one who threatens, because Cocles dared to tear down the bridge, and Cloelia broke her bonds and swam the river. Highest of all Manlius, warder of the Tarpeian fortress, stood with the temple behind him and held the high Capitoline; and the thatch of Romulus' palace stood rough and fresh. And here the silver goose, fluttering in the gilded colonnades, cried that the Gauls were there on the threshold. The Gauls were there among the brushwood, hard on the fortress, secure in the darkness and the dower of shadowy night. Their clustering locks are of gold, and of gold their attire; their striped cloaks glitter, and their milk-white necks are entwined with gold. Two Alpine pikes sparkle in the hand of each, and long shields guard their bodies. Here he had embossed the dancing Salii and the naked Luperci, the crests wreathed in wool, and the sacred shields that fell from heaven; in cushioned cars the virtuous matrons led on their rites through the city. Far hence he adds the habitations of hell also, the high gates of Dis and the dooms of guilt; and thee, O Catiline, clinging on the beetling rock, and shuddering at the faces of the Furies; and far apart the good, and Cato delivering them statutes. Amidst it all flows wide the likeness of the swelling sea, wrought in gold, though the foam surged gray upon blue water; and round about dolphins, in shining silver, swept the seas with their tails in circle as they cleft the tide. In the centre were visible the brazen war-fleets of Actium; thou mightest see all Leucate swarm in embattled array, and the waves gleam with gold. Here Caesar Augustus, leading Italy to battle with Fathers and People, with gods of household and of state, stands on the lofty stern; prosperous flames jet round his brow, and his ancestral star dawns overhead. Elsewhere Agrippa, with favouring winds and gods, proudly leads on his column; on his brows glitters the prow-girt naval crown, the haughty emblazonment of the war. Here Antonius with barbarian aid and motley arms, from the conquered nations of the Dawn and the shore of the southern sea, carries with him Egypt and the Eastern forces of utmost Bactra, and the shameful Egyptian woman goes as his consort. All at once rush on, and the whole ocean is torn into foam by straining oars and triple-pointed prows. They steer to sea; one might think that the Cyclades were uptorn and floated on the main, or that lofty mountains clashed with mountains, so mightily do their crews urge on the turreted ships. Flaming tow and the winged steel of darts shower thickly from their hands; the fields of ocean redden with fresh slaughter. Midmost the Queen calls on her squadron with the timbrel of her country, nor yet casts back a glance on the twin snakes behind her. Howling Anubis, and gods monstrous and multitudinous, level their arms against Neptune and Venus and against Minerva; Mars rages amid the havoc, graven in iron, and the Fatal Sisters hang aloft, and Discord strides rejoicing with garment rent, and Bellona attends her with blood-stained scourge. Looking thereon, Actian Apollo above drew his bow; with the terror of it all Egypt and India, every Arab and Sabaean, turned back in flight. The Queen herself seemed to call the winds and spread her sails, and even now let her sheets run slack. Her the Lord of Fire had fashioned amid the carnage, wan with the shadow of death, borne along by the waves and the north-west wind; and over against her the vast bulk of mourning Nile, opening out his folds and calling with all his raiment the conquered people into his blue lap and the coverture of his streams. But Caesar rode into the city of Rome in triple triumph, and dedicated his vowed offering to the gods to stand for ever, three hundred stately shrines all about the city. The streets were loud with gladness and games and shouting. In all the temples was a band of matrons, in all were altars, and before the altars slain steers strewed the ground. Himself he sits on the snowy threshold of Phoebus the bright, reviews the gifts of the nations and ranges them on the haughty doors. The conquered tribes move in long line, diverse as in tongue, so in fashion of dress and armour. Here Mulciber had designed the Nomad race and the ungirt Africans, here the Leleges and Carians and archer Gelonians. Euphrates went by now with smoother waves, and the Morini utmost of men, and the hornèd Rhine, the untamed Dahae, and Araxes chafing under his bridge. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At Venus aetherios inter dea candida nimbos<br>dona ferens aderat;
