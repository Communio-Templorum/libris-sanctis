Right under Antandros and the mountains of Phrygian Ida we build a fleet, uncertain whither the fates carry us or where a resting-place is given, and gather the people together. Scarcely had the first summer set in, when lord Anchises bids us spread our sails to fortune, and weeping I leave the shores and havens of my country, and the plains where once was Troy. I sail to sea an exile, with my comrades and son and the gods of household and state. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postquam res Asiae Priamique euertere gentem<br>immeritam uisum superis, ceciditque superbum<br>Ilium et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troia,<br>diuersa exsilia et desertas quaerere terras<br>auguriis agimur diuum, classemque sub ipsa<br>Antandro et Phrygiae molimur montibus Idae,<br>incerti quo fata ferant, ubi sistere detur,<br>contrahimusque uiros. uix prima inceperat aestas<br>et pater Anchises dare fatis uela iubebat,<br>litora cum patriae lacrimans portusque relinquo<br>et campos ubi Troia fuit. feror exsul in altum<br>cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"A land of vast plains lies apart, the home of Mavors, in Thracian tillage, and sometime under warrior Lycurgus' reign; friendly of old to Troy, and their gods in alliance while our fortune lasted. Hither I pass, and on the winding shore I lay under thwarting fates the first foundations of a city, and from my own name fashion its name, Aeneadae. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Terra procul uastis colitur Mauortia campis<br>(Thraces arant) acri quondam regnata Lycurgo,<br>hospitium antiquum Troiae sociique penates<br>dum fortuna fuit. feror huc et litore curuo<br>moenia prima loco fatis ingressus iniquis<br>Aeneadasque meo nomen de nomine fingo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"I was paying sacrifice to my mother, daughter of Dione, and to all the gods, so to favour the work begun, and slew a shining bull on the shore to the high lord of the heavenly people. Haply there lay a mound hard at hand, crowned with cornel thickets and bristling dense with shafts of myrtle. I drew near; and essaying to tear up the green wood from the soil, that I might cover the altar with leafy boughs, I see a portent ominous and wonderful to tell. For from the first tree whose roots are rent away and broken from the ground, drops of black blood trickle, and gore stains the earth. An icy shudder shakes my limbs, and my blood curdles chill with terror. Yet from another I go on again to tear away a tough shoot, fully to fathom its secret; yet from another black blood follows out of the bark. With many searchings of heart I prayed the woodland nymphs, and lord Gradivus, who rules in the Getic fields, to make the sight propitious as was meet and lighten the omen. But when I assail a third spearshaft with a stronger effort, pulling with knees pressed against the sand; shall I speak or be silent? from beneath the mound is heard a pitiable moan, and a voice is uttered to my ears: 'Woe's me, why rendest thou me, Aeneas? spare me at last in the tomb, spare pollution to thine innocent hands. Troy bore me; not alien to thee am I, nor this blood that oozes from the stem. Ah, fly the cruel land, fly the greedy shore! For I am Polydorus; here the iron harvest of weapons hath covered my pierced body, and shot up in sharp javelins.' Then indeed, borne down with dubious terror, I was motionless, my hair stood up, and the accents faltered on my tongue. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">sacra Dionaeae matri diuisque ferebam<br>auspicibus coeptorum operum, superoque nitentem<br>caelicolum regi mactabam in litore taurum.<br>forte fuit iuxta tumulus, quo cornea summo<br>uirgulta et densis hastilibus horrida myrtus.<br>accessi uiridemque ab humo conuellere siluam<br>conatus, ramis tegerem ut frondentibus aras,<br>horrendum et dictu uideo mirabile monstrum.<br>nam quae prima solo ruptis radicibus arbos<br>uellitur, huic atro liquuntur sanguine guttae<br>et terram tabo maculant. mihi frigidus horror<br>membra quatit gelidusque coit formidine sanguis.<br>rursus et alterius lentum conuellere uimen<br>insequor et causas penitus temptare latentis;<br>ater et alterius sequitur de cortice sanguis.<br>multa mouens animo Nymphas uenerabar agrestis<br>Gradiuumque patrem, Geticis qui praesidet aruis,<br>rite secundarent uisus omenque leuarent.<br>tertia sed postquam maiore hastilia nisu<br>adgredior genibusque aduersae obluctor harenae,<br>(eloquar an sileam?) gemitus lacrimabilis imo<br>auditur tumulo et uox reddita fertur ad auris:<br>'quid miserum, Aenea, laceras? iam parce sepulto,<br>parce pias scelerare manus. non me tibi Troia<br>externum tulit aut cruor hic de stipite manat.<br>heu fuge crudelis terras, fuge litus auarum:<br>nam Polydorus ego. hic confixum ferrea texit<br>telorum seges et iaculis increuit acutis.'<br>tum uero ancipiti mentem formidine pressus<br>obstipui steteruntque comae et uox faucibus haesit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"This Polydorus once with great weight of gold had hapless Priam sent in secret to the nurture of the Thracian king, when now he was losing trust in the arms of Dardania, and saw his city leaguered round about. The king, when the Teucrian power was broken and fortune withdrew, following Agamemnon's estate and triumphant arms, severs every bond of duty; murders Polydorus, and lays strong hands on the gold. O accursed hunger of gold, to what dost thou not compel human hearts! When the terror left my senses, I lay the divine tokens before the chosen princes of the people, with my father at their head, and demand their judgment. All are of one mind, to leave the guilty land, and abandoning a polluted home, to let the gales waft our fleets. So we bury Polydorus anew, and the earth is heaped high over his mound; altars are reared to his ghost, sad with dusky chaplets and black cypress; and around are the Ilian women with hair unbound in their fashion. We offer bubbling bowls of warm milk and cups of consecrated blood, and lay the spirit to rest in her tomb, and with loud voice utter the last call. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hunc Polydorum auri quondam cum pondere magno<br>infelix Priamus furtim mandarat alendum<br>Threicio regi, cum iam diffideret armis<br>Dardaniae cingique urbem obsidione uideret.<br>ille, ut opes fractae Teucrum et Fortuna recessit,<br>res Agamemnonias uictriciaque arma secutus<br>fas omne abrumpit: Polydorum obtruncat, et auro<br>ui potitur. quid non mortalia pectora cogis,<br>auri sacra fames! postquam pauor ossa reliquit,<br>delectos populi ad proceres primumque parentem<br>monstra deum refero, et quae sit sententia posco.<br>omnibus idem animus, scelerata excedere terra,<br>linqui pollutum hospitium et dare classibus Austros.<br>ergo instauramus Polydoro funus, et ingens<br>aggeritur tumulo tellus; stant Manibus arae<br>caeruleis maestae uittis atraque cupresso,<br>et circum Iliades crinem de more solutae;<br>inferimus tepido spumantia cymbia lacte<br>sanguinis et sacri pateras, animamque sepulcro<br>condimus et magna supremum uoce ciemus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Thereupon, so soon as ocean may be trusted, and the winds leave the seas in quiet, and the soft whispering south wind calls seaward, my comrades launch their ships and crowd the shores. We put out from harbour, and lands and towns sink away. There lies in mid sea a holy land, most dear to the mother of the Nereids and Neptune of Aegae, which strayed about coast and strand till the Archer god in his affection chained it fast from high Myconos and Gyaros, and made it lie immoveable and slight the winds. Hither I steer; and it welcomes my weary crew to the quiet shelter of a safe haven. We disembark and worship Apollo's town. Anius the king, king at once of the people and priest of Phoebus, his brows garlanded with fillets and consecrated laurel, comes to meet us; he knows Anchises, his friend of old; we clasp hands in welcome, and enter his palace. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Inde ubi prima fides pelago, placataque uenti<br>dant maria et lenis crepitans uocat Auster in altum,<br>deducunt socii nauis et litora complent;<br>prouehimur portu terraeque urbesque recedunt.<br>sacra mari colitur medio gratissima tellus<br>Nereidum matri et Neptuno Aegaeo,<br>quam pius arquitenens oras et litora circum<br>errantem Mycono e celsa Gyaroque reuinxit,<br>immotamque coli dedit et contemnere uentos.<br>huc feror, haec fessos tuto placidissima portu<br>accipit; egressi ueneramur Apollinis urbem.<br>rex Anius, rex idem hominum Phoebique sacerdos,<br>uittis et sacra redimitus tempora lauro<br>occurrit; ueterem Anchisen agnouit amicum.<br>iungimus hospitio dextras et tecta subimus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>I worshipped the god's temple, an ancient pile of stone. 'Lord of Thymbra, give us an enduring dwelling-place; grant a house and family to thy weary servants, and a city to abide: keep Troy's second fortress, the remnant left of the Grecians and merciless Achilles. Whom follow we? or whither dost thou bid us go, where fix our seat? Grant an omen, O lord, and inspire our minds.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Templa dei saxo uenerabar structa uetusto:<br>'da propriam, Thymbraee, domum; da moenia fessis<br>et genus et mansuram urbem; serua altera Troiae<br>Pergama, reliquias Danaum atque immitis Achilli.<br>quem sequimur? quoue ire iubes? ubi ponere sedes?<br>da, pater, augurium atque animis inlabere nostris.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Scarcely had I spoken thus; suddenly all seemed to shake, all the courts and laurels of the god, the whole hill to be stirred round about, and the cauldron to moan in the opening sanctuary. We sink low on the ground, and a voice is borne to our ears: 'Stubborn race of Dardanus, the same land that bore you by parentage of old shall receive you again on her bountiful breast. Seek out your ancient mother; hence shall the house of Aeneas sway all regions, his children's children and they who shall be born of them.' Thus Phoebus; and mingled outcries of great gladness uprose; all ask, what is that city? whither calls Phoebus our wandering, and bids us return? Then my father, unrolling the records of men of old, 'Hear, O princes,' says he, 'and learn your hopes. In mid ocean lies Crete, the island of high Jove, wherein is mount Ida, the cradle of our race. An hundred great towns are inhabited in that opulent realm; from it our forefather Teucer of old, if I recall the tale aright, sailed to the Rhoetean coasts and chose a place for his kingdom. Not yet was Ilium nor the towers of Pergama reared; they dwelt in the valley bottoms. Hence came our Lady, haunter of Cybele, the Corybantic cymbals and the grove of Ida; hence the rites of inviolate secrecy, and the lions yoked under the chariot of their mistress. Up then, and let us follow where divine commandments lead; let us appease the winds, and seek the realm of Gnosus. Nor is it a far journey away. Only be Jupiter favourable, the third day shall bring our fleet to anchor on the Cretan coast.' So spoke he, and slew fit sacrifice on the altars, a bull to Neptune, a bull to thee, fair Apollo, a black sheep to Tempest, a white to the prosperous West winds. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">uix ea fatus eram: tremere omnia uisa repente,<br>liminaque laurusque dei, totusque moueri<br>mons circum et mugire adytis cortina reclusis.<br>summissi petimus terram et uox fertur ad auris:<br>'Dardanidae duri, quae uos a stirpe parentum<br>prima tulit tellus, eadem uos ubere laeto<br>accipiet reduces. antiquam exquirite matrem.<br>hic domus Aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris<br>et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis.'<br>haec Phoebus; mixtoque ingens exorta tumultu<br>laetitia, et cuncti quae sint ea moenia quaerunt,<br>quo Phoebus uocet errantis iubeatque reuerti.<br>tum genitor ueterum uoluens monimenta uirorum<br>'audite, o proceres,' ait 'et spes discite uestras.<br>Creta Iouis magni medio iacet insula ponto,<br>mons Idaeus ubi et gentis cunabula nostrae.<br>centum urbes habitant magnas, uberrima regna,<br>maximus unde pater, si rite audita recordor,<br>Teucrus Rhoeteas primum est aduectus in oras,<br>optauitque locum regno. nondum Ilium et arces<br>Pergameae steterant; habitabant uallibus imis.<br>hinc mater cultrix Cybeli Corybantiaque aera<br>Idaeumque nemus, hinc fida silentia sacris,<br>et iuncti currum dominae subiere leones.<br>ergo agite et diuum ducunt qua iussa sequamur:<br>placemus uentos et Cnosia regna petamus.<br>nec longo distant cursu: modo Iuppiter adsit,<br>tertia lux classem Cretaeis sistet in oris.'<br>sic fatus meritos aris mactauit honores,<br>taurum Neptuno, taurum tibi, pulcher Apollo,<br>nigram Hiemi pecudem, Zephyris felicibus albam.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Rumour flies that Idomeneus the captain is driven forth of his father's realm, and the shores of Crete are abandoned, that the houses are void of foes and the dwellings lie empty to our hand. We leave the harbour of Ortygia, and fly along the main, by the revel-trod ridges of Naxos, by green Donusa, Olearos and snow-white Paros, and the sea-strewn Cyclades, threading the racing channels among the crowded lands. The seamen's clamour rises in emulous dissonance; each cheers his comrade: <i>Seek we Crete and our forefathers.</i> A wind rising astern follows us forth on our way, and we glide at last to the ancient Curetean coast. So I set eagerly to work on the walls of my chosen town, and call it Pergamea, and exhort my people, joyful at the name, to cherish their homes and rear the castle buildings. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Fama uolat pulsum regnis cessisse paternis<br>Idomenea ducem, desertaque litora Cretae,<br>hoste uacare domum sedesque astare relictas.<br>linquimus Ortygiae portus pelagoque uolamus<br>bacchatamque iugis Naxon uiridemque Donusam,<br>Olearon niueamque Paron sparsasque per aequor<br>Cycladas, et crebris legimus freta concita terris.<br>nauticus exoritur uario certamine clamor:<br>hortantur socii Cretam proauosque petamus.<br>prosequitur surgens a puppi uentus euntis,<br>et tandem antiquis Curetum adlabimur oris.<br>ergo auidus muros optatae molior urbis<br>Pergameamque uoco, et laetam cognomine gentem<br>hortor amare focos arcemque attollere tectis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And even now the ships were drawn up on the dry beach; the people were busy in marriages and among their new fields; I was giving statutes and homesteads; when suddenly from a tainted space of sky came, noisome on men's bodies and pitiable on trees and crops, pestilence and a year of death. They left their sweet lives or dragged themselves on in misery; Sirius scorched the fields into barrenness; the herbage grew dry, and the sickly harvest denied sustenance. My father counsels to remeasure the sea and go again to Phoebus in his Ortygian oracle, to pray for grace and ask what issue he ordains to our exhausted state; whence he bids us search for aid to our woes, whither bend our course. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque fere sicco subductae litore puppes,<br>conubiis aruisque nouis operata iuuentus,<br>iura domosque dabam, subito cum tabida membris<br>corrupto caeli tractu miserandaque uenit<br>arboribusque satisque lues et letifer annus.<br>linquebant dulcis animas aut aegra trahebant<br>corpora; tum sterilis exurere Sirius agros,<br>arebant herbae et uictum seges aegra negabat.<br>rursus ad oraclum Ortygiae Phoebumque remenso<br>hortatur pater ire mari ueniamque precari,<br>quam fessis finem rebus ferat, unde laborum<br>temptare auxilium iubeat, quo uertere cursus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Night fell, and sleep held all things living on the earth. The sacred images of the gods and the household deities of Phrygia, that I had borne with me from Troy out of the midst of the burning city, seemed to stand before mine eyes as I lay sleepless, clear in the broad light where the full moon poured through the latticed windows; then thus addressed me, and with this speech allayed my distresses: 'What Apollo hath to tell thee when thou dost reach Ortygia, he utters here, and sends us unsought to thy threshold. We who followed thee and thine arms when Dardania went down in fire; we who under thee have traversed on shipboard the swelling sea; we in like wise will exalt to heaven thy children to be, and give empire to their city. Do thou prepare a mighty town for a mighty people, nor draw back from the long wearisome chase. Thou must change thy dwelling. Not to these shores did the god at Delos counsel thee, or Apollo bid thee find rest in Crete. There is a region Greeks name Hesperia, an ancient land, mighty in arms and foison of the clod; Oenotrian men dwell therein; now rumour is that a younger race have called it Italy after their captain's name. This is our true dwelling place; hence is Dardanus sprung, and lord Iasius, the first source of our race. Up, arise, and tell with good cheer to thine aged parent this plain tale, to seek Corythus and the lands of Ausonia. Jupiter denies thee the Dictaean fields.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Nox erat et terris animalia somnus habebat:<br>effigies sacrae diuum Phrygiique penates,<br>quos mecum a Troia mediisque ex ignibus urbis<br>extuleram, uisi ante oculos astare iacentis<br>in somnis multo manifesti lumine, qua se<br>plena per insertas fundebat luna fenestras;<br>tum sic adfari et curas his demere dictis:<br>'quod tibi delato Ortygiam dicturus Apollo est,<br>hic canit et tua nos en ultro ad limina mittit.<br>nos te Dardania incensa tuaque arma secuti,<br>nos tumidum sub te permensi classibus aequor,<br>idem uenturos tollemus in astra nepotes<br>imperiumque urbi dabimus. tu moenia magnis<br>magna para longumque fugae ne linque laborem.<br>mutandae sedes. non haec tibi litora suasit<br>Delius aut Cretae iussit considere Apollo.<br>est locus, Hesperiam Grai cognomine dicunt,<br>terra antiqua, potens armis atque ubere glaebae;<br>Oenotri coluere uiri; nunc fama minores<br>Italiam dixisse ducis de nomine gentem.<br>hae nobis propriae sedes, hinc Dardanus ortus<br>Iasiusque pater, genus a quo principe nostrum.<br>surge age et haec laetus longaeuo dicta parenti<br>haud dubitanda refer: Corythum terrasque requirat<br>Ausonias; Dictaea negat tibi Iuppiter arua.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Astonished at this vision and divine utterance (nor was that slumber; but openly I seemed to know their countenances, their veiled hair and gracious faces, and therewith a cold sweat broke out all over me) I spring from my bed and raise my voice and upturned hands skyward and pay pure offering on the hearth. The sacrifice done, I joyfully tell Anchises, and relate all in order. He recognises the double descent and twofold parentage, and the later wanderings that had deceived him among ancient lands. Then he speaks: 'O son, hard wrought by the destinies of Ilium, Cassandra only foretold me this fortune. Now I recall how she prophesied this was fated to our race, and often cried of Hesperia, often of an Italian realm. But who was to believe that Teucrians should come to Hesperian shores? or whom might Cassandra then move by prophecy? Yield we to Phoebus, and follow the better way he counsels.' So says he, and we all rejoicingly obey his speech. This dwelling likewise we abandon; and leaving some few behind, spread our sails and run over the waste sea in our hollow wood. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">talibus attonitus uisis et uoce deorum<br>(nec sopor illud erat, sed coram agnoscere uultus<br>uelatasque comas praesentiaque ora uidebar;<br>tum gelidus toto manabat corpore sudor)<br>corripio e stratis corpus tendoque supinas<br>ad caelum cum uoce manus et munera libo<br>intemerata focis. perfecto laetus honore<br>Anchisen facio certum remque ordine pando.<br>agnouit prolem ambiguam geminosque parentis,<br>seque nouo ueterum deceptum errore locorum.<br>tum memorat: 'nate, Iliacis exercite fatis,<br>sola mihi talis casus Cassandra canebat.<br>nunc repeto haec generi portendere debita nostro<br>et saepe Hesperiam, saepe Itala regna uocare.<br>sed quis ad Hesperiae uenturos litora Teucros<br>crederet? aut quem tum uates Cassandra moueret?<br>cedamus Phoebo et moniti meliora sequamur.'<br>sic ait, et cuncti dicto paremus ouantes.<br>hanc quoque deserimus sedem paucisque relictis<br>uela damus uastumque caua trabe currimus aequor.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"After our ships held the high seas, nor any land yet appears, the sky all round us and all round us the deep, a dusky shower drew up overhead carrying night and tempest, and the wave shuddered and gloomed. Straightway the winds upturn the main, and great seas rise; we are tossed asunder over the dreary gulf. Stormclouds enwrap the day, and rainy gloom blots out the sky; out of the clouds bursts fire fast upon fire. Driven from our course, we go wandering on the blind waves. Palinurus himself professes he cannot tell day from night on the sky, nor remember the way amid the waters. Three dubious days of blind darkness we wander on the deep, as many nights without a star. Not till the fourth day was land at last seen to rise, discovering distant hills and sending up wreaths of smoke. The sails drop; we swing back to the oars; without delay the sailors strongly toss up the foam, and sweep through the green water. The shores of the Strophades first receive me thus won from the waves, Strophades the Greek name they bear, islands lying in the great Ionian sea, which boding Celaeno and the other Harpies inhabit since Phineus' house was shut on them, and they fled in terror from the board of old. Than these no deadlier portent nor any fiercer plague of divine wrath hath issued from the Stygian waters; winged things with maidens' countenance, bellies dropping filth, and clawed hands and faces ever wan with hunger… <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postquam altum tenuere rates nec iam amplius ullae<br>apparent terrae, caelum undique et undique pontus,<br>tum mihi caeruleus supra caput astitit imber<br>noctem hiememque ferens, et inhorruit unda tenebris.<br>continuo uenti uoluunt mare magnaque surgunt<br>aequora, dispersi iactamur gurgite uasto;<br>inuoluere diem nimbi et nox umida caelum<br>abstulit, ingeminant abruptis nubibus ignes,<br>excutimur cursu et caecis erramus in undis.<br>ipse diem noctemque negat discernere caelo<br>nec meminisse uiae media Palinurus in unda.<br>tris adeo incertos caeca caligine soles<br>erramus pelago, totidem sine sidere noctes.<br>quarto terra die primum se attollere tandem<br>uisa, aperire procul montis ac uoluere fumum.<br>uela cadunt, remis insurgimus; haud mora, nautae<br>adnixi torquent spumas et caerula uerrunt.<br>seruatum ex undis Strophadum me litora primum<br>excipiunt.

We attack them with the sword, and call the gods and Jove himself to share our spoil. Then we build seats on the winding shore and banquet on the dainty food. But suddenly the Harpies are upon us, swooping awfully from the mountains, and shaking their wings with loud clangour, plunder the feast, and defile everything with unclean touch, spreading a foul smell, and uttering dreadful cries. Again, in a deep recess under a caverned rock, shut in with waving shadows of woodland, we array the board and renew the altar fires; again, from their blind ambush in diverse quarters of the sky, the noisy crowd flutter with clawed feet around their prey, defiling the feast with their lips. Then I bid my comrades take up arms, and proclaim war on the accursed race. Even as I bade they do, range their swords in cover among the grass, and hide their shields out of sight. So when they swooped clamorously down along the winding shore, Misenus from his watch-tower on high signals on the hollow brass; my comrades rush in and essay the strange battle, to set the stain of steel on the winged horrors of the sea. But they take no violence on their plumage, nor wounds on their bodies; and soaring into the firmament with rapid flight, leave their foul traces on the spoil they had half consumed. Celaeno alone, prophetess of ill, alights on a towering cliff, and thus breaks forth in deep accents: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">huc ubi delati portus intrauimus, ecce<br>laeta boum passim campis armenta uidemus<br>caprigenumque pecus nullo custode per herbas.<br>inruimus ferro et diuos ipsumque uocamus<br>in partem praedamque Iouem; tum litore curuo<br>exstruimusque toros dapibusque epulamur opimis.<br>at subitae horrifico lapsu de montibus adsunt<br>Harpyiae et magnis quatiunt clangoribus alas,<br>diripiuntque dapes contactuque omnia foedant<br>immundo; tum uox taetrum dira inter odorem.<br>rursum in secessu longo sub rupe cauata<br>[arboribus clausam circum atque horrentibus umbris]<br>instruimus mensas arisque reponimus ignem;<br>rursum ex diuerso caeli caecisque latebris<br>turba sonans praedam pedibus circumuolat uncis,<br>polluit ore dapes. sociis tunc arma capessant<br>edico, et dira bellum cum gente gerendum.<br>haud secus ac iussi faciunt tectosque per herbam<br>disponunt ensis et scuta latentia condunt.<br>ergo ubi delapsae sonitum per curua dedere<br>litora, dat signum specula Misenus ab alta<br>aere cauo. inuadunt socii et noua proelia temptant,<br>obscenas pelagi ferro foedare uolucris.<br>sed neque uim plumis ullam nec uulnera tergo<br>accipiunt, celerique fuga sub sidera lapsae<br>semesam praedam et uestigia foeda relinquunt.<br>una in praecelsa consedit rupe Celaeno,<br>infelix uates, rumpitque hanc pectore uocem;</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"'War is it for your slaughtered oxen and steers cut down, O children of Laomedon, war is it you would declare, and drive the guiltless Harpies from their ancestral kingdom?

But my comrades' blood froze chill with sudden affright; their spirits fell; and no longer with arms, nay with vows and prayers they bid me entreat favour, whether these be goddesses, or winged things ill-ominous and foul. And lord Anchises from the beach calls with outspread hands on the mighty gods, ordering fit sacrifices: 'Gods, avert their menaces! Gods, turn this woe away, and graciously save the righteous!' Then he bids pluck the cable from the shore and shake loose the sheets. Southern winds stretch the sails; we scud over the foam-flecked waters, whither wind and pilot called our course. Now wooded Zacynthos appears amid the waves, and Dulichium and Same and Neritos' sheer rocks. We fly past the cliffs of Ithaca, Laërtes' realm, and curse the land, fostress of cruel Ulysses. Soon too Mount Leucata's cloudy peaks are sighted, and Apollo dreaded of sailors. Hither we steer wearily, and stand in to the little town. The anchor is cast from the prow; the sterns are grounded on the beach. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">dixit, et in siluam pennis ablata refugit.<br>at sociis subita gelidus formidine sanguis<br>deriguit: cecidere animi, nec iam amplius armis,<br>sed uotis precibusque iubent exposcere pacem,<br>siue deae seu sint dirae obscenaeque uolucres.<br>et pater Anchises passis de litore palmis<br>numina magna uocat meritosque indicit honores:<br>'di, prohibete minas; di, talem auertite casum<br>et placidi seruate pios.' tum litore funem<br>deripere excussosque iubet laxare rudentis.<br>tendunt uela Noti: fugimus spumantibus undis<br>qua cursum uentusque gubernatorque uocabat.<br>iam medio apparet fluctu nemorosa Zacynthos<br>Dulichiumque Sameque et Neritos ardua saxis.<br>effugimus scopulos Ithacae, Laertia regna,<br>et terram altricem saeui exsecramur Vlixi.<br>mox et Leucatae nimbosa cacumina montis<br>et formidatus nautis aperitur Apollo.<br>hunc petimus fessi et paruae succedimus urbi;<br>ancora de prora iacitur, stant litore puppes.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"So at last having attained to land beyond our hopes, we purify ourselves in Jove's worship, and kindle altars of offering, and make the Actian shore gay with the games of Ilium. My comrades strip, and, slippery with oil, exercise their ancestral contests; glad to have got past so many Argive towns, and held on their flight through the encircling foe. Meanwhile the sun rounds the great circle of the year, and icy winter ruffles the waters with Northern gales. I fix against the doorway a hollow shield of brass, that tall Abas had borne, and mark the story with a verse: <i>These arms Aeneas from the conquering Greeks.</i> Then I bid leave the harbour and sit down at the thwarts; emulously my comrades strike the water, and sweep through the seas.

I stood amazed; and my heart kindled with marvellous desire to accost him and learn of so strange a fortune. I advance from the harbour, leaving the fleet ashore; just when haply Andromache, in a grove before the town, by the waters of a feigned Simoïs, was pouring libation to the dust, and calling Hector's ghost to a tomb with his name, on an empty turfed green with two altars that she had consecrated, a wellspring of tears. When she caught sight of me coming, and saw distractedly the encircling arms of Troy, terror-stricken at the vision marvellously shewn, her gaze fixed, and the heat left her frame. She swoons away, and hardly at last speaks after long interval: 'Comest thou then a real face, a real messenger to me, goddess-born? livest thou? or if sweet light is fled, ah, where is Hector?' She spoke, and bursting into tears filled all the place with her crying. Just a few words I force up, and deeply moved gasp out in broken accents: 'I live indeed, I live on through all extremities; doubt not, for real are the forms thou seest … Alas! after such an husband, what fate receives thy fall? or what worthier fortune revisits thee? Dost thou, Hector's Andromache, keep bonds of marriage with Pyrrhus?'

But him Orestes, aflame with passionate desire for his stolen bride, and driven by the furies of crime, catches unguarded and murders at his ancestral altars.

First must the Trinacrian wave clog thine oar, and thy ships traverse the salt Ausonian plain, by the infernal pools and Aeaean Circe's isle, ere thou mayest build thy city in safety on a peaceful land. I will tell thee the token, and do thou keep it close in thine heart. When in thy perplexity, beside the wave of a sequestered river, a great sow shall be discovered lying under the oaks on the brink, with her newborn litter of thirty, couched white on the ground, her white brood about her teats; that shall be the place of the city, that the appointed rest from thy toils. Neither shrink thou at the gnawn tables that await thee; the fates will find a way, and Apollo aid thy call. These lands moreover, on this nearest border of the Italian shore that our own sea's tide washes, flee thou: evil Greeks dwell in all their towns. Here the Locrians of Narycos have set their city, and here Lyctian Idomeneus beset the Sallentine plains with soldiery; here is the town of the Meliboean captain, Philoctetes' little Petelia fenced by her wall. Nay, when thy fleets have crossed overseas and lie at anchor, when now thou rearest altars and payest vows on the beach, veil thine hair with a purple garment for covering, that no hostile face at thy divine worship may meet thee amid the holy fires and make void the omens. This fashion of sacrifice keep thou, thyself and thy comrades, and let thy children abide in this pure observance. But when at thy departure the wind hath borne thee to the Sicilian coast, and the barred straits of Pelorus open out, steer for the left-hand country and the long circuit of the seas on the left hand; shun the shore and water on thy right. These lands, they say, of old broke asunder, torn and upheaved by vast force, when either country was one and undivided; the ocean burst in between, cutting off with its waves the Hesperian from the Sicilian coast, and with narrow tide washes tilth and town along the severance of shore. On the right Scylla keeps guard, on the left unassuaged Charybdis, who thrice swallows the vast flood sheer down her swirling gulf, and ever again hurls it upward, lashing the sky with water. But Scylla lies prisoned in her cavern's blind recesses, thrusting forth her mouth and drawing ships upon the rocks. In front her face is human, and her breast fair as a maiden's to the waist down; behind she is a sea-dragon of monstrous frame, with dolphins' tails joined on her wolf-girt belly. Better to track the goal of Trinacrian Pachynus, lingering and wheeling round through long spaces, than once catch sight of misshapen Scylla deep in her dreary cavern, and of the rocks that ring to her sea-coloured hounds. Moreover, if Helenus hath aught of foresight or his prophecy of assurance, if Apollo fills his spirit with the truth, this one thing, goddess-born, one thing for all will I foretell thee, and again and again repeat my counsel: to great Juno's deity be thy first prayer and worship; to Juno utter thy willing vows, and overcome thy mighty mistress with gifts and supplications; so at last thou shalt leave Trinacria behind, and be sped in triumph to the Italian borders. When borne hither thou drawest nigh the Cymaean city, the haunted lakes and rustling woods of Avernus, thou shalt behold the raving prophetess who deep in the rock chants of fate, and marks down her words on leaves. What verses she writes down on them, the maiden sorts into order and shuts behind her in the cave; they stay in their places unstirred and quit not their rank. But when at the turn of the hinge the light wind from the doorway stirs them, and disarranges the delicate foliage, never after does she trouble to capture them as they flutter about the hollow rock, nor restore their places or join the verses; men depart without counsel, and hate the Sibyl's dwelling. Here let no waste in delay be of such account to thee (though thy company chide, and the passage call thy sails strongly to the deep, and thou mayest fill out their folds to thy desire) that thou do not approach the prophetess, and plead with prayers that she herself utter her oracles and deign to loose the accents from her lips. The nations of Italy and the wars to come, and the fashion whereby every toil may be avoided or endured, she shall unfold to thee, and grant her worshipper prosperous passage. Thus far is our voice allowed to counsel thee: go thy way, and exalt Troy to heaven by thy deeds.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'Nate dea (nam te maioribus ire per altum<br>auspiciis manifesta fides; sic fata deum rex<br>sortitur uoluitque uices, is uertitur ordo),<br>pauca tibi e multis, quo tutior hospita lustres<br>aequora et Ausonio possis considere portu,<br>expediam dictis; prohibent nam cetera Parcae<br>scire Helenum farique uetat Saturnia Iuno.<br>principio Italiam, quam tu iam rere propinquam<br>uicinosque, ignare, paras inuadere portus,<br>longa procul longis uia diuidit inuia terris.<br>ante et Trinacria lentandus remus in unda<br>et salis Ausonii lustrandum nauibus aequor<br>infernique lacus Aeaeaeque insula Circae,<br>quam tuta possis urbem componere terra.<br>signa tibi dicam, tu condita mente teneto:<br>cum tibi sollicito secreti ad fluminis undam<br>litoreis ingens inuenta sub ilicibus sus<br>triginta capitum fetus enixa iacebit,<br>alba solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati,<br>is locus urbis erit, requies ea certa laborum.<br>nec tu mensarum morsus horresce futuros:<br>fata uiam inuenient aderitque uocatus Apollo.<br>has autem terras Italique hanc litoris oram,<br>proxima quae nostri perfunditur aequoris aestu,<br>effuge; cuncta malis habitantur moenia Grais.<br>hic et Narycii posuerunt moenia Locri,<br>et Sallentinos obsedit milite campos<br>Lyctius Idomeneus; hic illa ducis Meliboei<br>parua Philoctetae subnixa Petelia muro.<br>quin ubi transmissae steterint trans aequora classes<br>et positis aris iam uota in litore solues,<br>purpureo uelare comas adopertus amictu,<br>ne qua inter sanctos ignis in honore deorum<br>hostilis facies occurrat et omina turbet.<br>hunc socii morem sacrorum, hunc ipse teneto;<br>hac casti maneant in religione nepotes.<br>ast ubi digressum Siculae te admouerit orae<br>uentus, et angusti rarescent claustra Pelori,<br>laeua tibi tellus et longo laeua petantur<br>aequora circuitu; dextrum fuge litus et undas.<br>haec loca ui quondam et uasta conuulsa ruina<br>(tantum aeui longinqua ualet mutare uetustas)<br>dissiluisse ferunt, cum protinus utraque tellus<br>una foret: uenit medio ui pontus et undis<br>Hesperium Siculo latus abscidit, aruaque et urbes<br>litore diductas angusto interluit aestu.<br>dextrum Scylla latus, laeuum implacata Charybdis<br>obsidet, atque imo barathri ter gurgite uastos<br>sorbet in abruptum fluctus rursusque sub auras<br>erigit alternos, et sidera uerberat unda.<br>at Scyllam caecis cohibet spelunca latebris<br>ora exsertantem et nauis in saxa trahentem.<br>prima hominis facies et pulchro pectore uirgo<br>pube tenus, postrema immani corpore pistrix<br>delphinum caudas utero commissa luporum.<br>praestat Trinacrii metas lustrare Pachyni<br>cessantem, longos et circumflectere cursus,<br>quam semel informem uasto uidisse sub antro<br>Scyllam et caeruleis canibus resonantia saxa.<br>praeterea, si qua est Heleno prudentia uati,<br>si qua fides, animum si ueris implet Apollo,<br>unum illud tibi, nate dea, proque omnibus unum<br>praedicam et repetens iterumque iterumque monebo,<br>Iunonis magnae primum prece numen adora,<br>Iunoni cane uota libens dominamque potentem<br>supplicibus supera donis: sic denique uictor<br>Trinacria finis Italos mittere relicta.<br>huc ubi delatus Cumaeam accesseris urbem<br>diuinosque lacus et Auerna sonantia siluis,<br>insanam uatem aspicies, quae rupe sub ima<br>fata canit foliisque notas et nomina mandat.<br>quaecumque in foliis descripsit carmina uirgo<br>digerit in numerum atque antro seclusa relinquit:<br>illa manent immota locis neque ab ordine cedunt.<br>uerum eadem, uerso tenuis cum cardine uentus<br>impulit et teneras turbauit ianua frondes,<br>numquam deinde cauo uolitantia prendere saxo<br>nec reuocare situs aut iungere carmina curat:<br>inconsulti abeunt sedemque odere Sibyllae.<br>hic tibi ne qua morae fuerint dispendia tanti,<br>quamuis increpitent socii et ui cursus in altum<br>uela uocet, possisque sinus implere secundos,<br>quin adeas uatem precibusque oracula poscas<br>ipsa canat uocemque uolens atque ora resoluat.<br>illa tibi Italiae populos uenturaque bella<br>et quo quemque modo fugiasque ferasque laborem<br>expediet, cursusque dabit uenerata secundos.<br>haec sunt quae nostra liceat te uoce moneri.<br>uade age et ingentem factis fer ad aethera Troiam.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"This the seer uttered with friendly lips; then orders gifts to be carried to my ships, of heavy gold and sawn ivory, and loads the hulls with massy silver and cauldrons of Dodona, a mail coat triple-woven with hooks of gold, and a helmet splendid with spike and tressed plumes, the armour of Neoptolemus.

The breezes freshen at his prayer, and now the harbour opens out nearer at hand, and a temple appears on the Fort of Minerva. My comrades furl the sails and swing the prows to shore. The harbour is scooped into an arch by the Eastern flood; reefs run out and foam with the salt spray; itself it lies concealed; turreted walls of rock let down their arms on either hand, and the temple retreats from the beach.

Next is descried the bay of Tarentum, town, if rumour is true, of Hercules. Over against it the goddess of Lacinium rears her head, with the towers of Caulon, and Scylaceum wrecker of ships. Then Trinacrian Aetna is descried in the distance rising from the waves, and we hear from afar a great roaring of the sea on beaten rocks, and broken noises by the shore: the channels boil up, and the surge churns with sand. And lord Anchises: 'Of a surety this is that Charybdis; of these cliffs, these awful rocks did Helenus prophesy. Out, O comrades, and rise together to the oars.' Even as bidden they do; and first Palinurus swung the gurgling prow leftward through the water; to the left all our squadron bent with oar and wind. We are lifted skyward on the crescent wave, and again sunk deep into the nether world as the water is sucked away. Thrice amid their rocky caverns the cliffs uttered a cry; thrice we see the foam flung out, and the stars through a dripping veil. Meanwhile the wind falls with sundown; and weary and ignorant of the way we glide on to the Cyclopes' coast. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haud mora, continuo perfectis ordine uotis<br>cornua uelatarum obuertimus antemnarum,<br>Graiugenumque domos suspectaque linquimus arua.<br>hinc sinus Herculei (si uera est fama) Tarenti<br>cernitur, attollit se diua Lacinia contra,<br>Caulonisque arces et nauifragum Scylaceum.<br>tum procul e fluctu Trinacria cernitur Aetna,<br>et gemitum ingentem pelagi pulsataque saxa<br>audimus longe fractasque ad litora uoces,<br>exsultantque uada atque aestu miscentur harenae.<br>et pater Anchises 'nimirum hic illa Charybdis:<br>hos Helenus scopulos, haec saxa horrenda canebat.<br>eripite, o socii, pariterque insurgite remis.'<br>haud minus ac iussi faciunt, primusque rudentem<br>contorsit laeuas proram Palinurus ad undas;<br>laeuam cuncta cohors remis uentisque petiuit.<br>tollimur in caelum curuato gurgite, et idem<br>subducta ad Manis imos desedimus unda.<br>ter scopuli clamorem inter caua saxa dedere,<br>ter spumam elisam et rorantia uidimus astra.<br>interea fessos uentus cum sole reliquit,<br>ignarique uiae Cyclopum adlabimur oris.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"There lies a harbour large and unstirred by the winds' entrance; but nigh it Aetna thunders awfully in wrack, and ever and again hurls a black cloud into the sky, smoking with boiling pitch and embers white hot, and heaves balls of flame flickering up to the stars: ever and again vomits out on high crags from the torn entrails of the mountain, tosses up masses of molten rock with a groan, and boils forth from the bottom. Rumour is that this mass weighs down the body of Enceladus, half-consumed by the thunderbolt, and mighty Aetna laid over him suspires the flame that bursts from her furnaces; and so often as he changes his weary side, all Trinacria shudders and moans, veiling the sky in smoke. That night we spend in cover of the forest among portentous horrors, and see not from what source the noise comes. For neither did the stars show their fires, nor was the vault of constellated sky clear; but vapours blotted heaven, and the moon was held in a storm-cloud through dead of night. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Portus ab accessu uentorum immotus et ingens<br>ipse: sed horrificis iuxta tonat Aetna ruinis,<br>interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem<br>turbine fumantem piceo et candente fauilla,<br>attollitque globos flammarum et sidera lambit;<br>interdum scopulos auulsaque uiscera montis<br>erigit eructans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras<br>cum gemitu glomerat fundoque exaestuat imo.<br>fama est Enceladi semustum fulmine corpus<br>urgeri mole hac, ingentemque insuper Aetnam<br>impositam ruptis flammam exspirare caminis,<br>et fessum quotiens mutet latus, intremere omnem<br>murmure Trinacriam et caelum subtexere fumo.<br>noctem illam tecti siluis immania monstra<br>perferimus, nec quae sonitum det causa uidemus.<br>nam neque erant astrorum ignes nec lucidus aethra<br>siderea polus, obscuro sed nubila caelo,<br>et lunam in nimbo nox intempesta tenebat.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"And now the morrow was rising in the early east, and the dewy darkness rolled away from the sky by Dawn, when sudden out of the forest advances a human shape strange and unknown, worn with uttermost hunger and pitiably attired, and stretches entreating hands towards the shore. We look back. Filthy and wretched, with shaggy beard and a coat pinned together with thorns, he was yet a Greek, and had been sent of old to Troy in his father's arms. And he, when he saw afar the Dardanian habits and armour of Troy, hung back a little in terror at the sight, and stayed his steps; then ran headlong to the shore with weeping and prayers: 'By the heavens I beseech you, by the heavenly powers and this luminous sky that gives us breath, take me up, O Trojans, carry me away to any land soever, and it will be enough. I know I am one out of the Grecian fleets, I confess I warred against the household gods of Ilium; for that, if our wrong and guilt is so great, throw me piecemeal on the flood or plunge me in the waste sea. If I do perish, gladly will I perish at human hands.' He ended; and clung clasping our knees and grovelling at them. We encourage him to tell who he is and of what blood born, and reveal how Fortune pursues him since then. Lord Anchises after little delay gives him his hand, and strengthens his courage by visible pledge. At last, laying aside his terror, he speaks thus: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postera iamque dies primo surgebat Eoo<br>umentemque Aurora polo dimouerat umbram,<br>cum subito e siluis macie confecta suprema<br>ignoti noua forma uiri miserandaque cultu<br>procedit supplexque manus ad litora tendit.<br>respicimus. dira inluuies immissaque barba,<br>consertum tegimen spinis: at cetera Graius,<br>et quondam patriis ad Troiam missus in armis.<br>isque ubi Dardanios habitus et Troia uidit<br>arma procul, paulum aspectu conterritus haesit<br>continuitque gradum; mox sese ad litora praeceps<br>cum fletu precibusque tulit: 'per sidera testor,<br>per superos atque hoc caeli spirabile lumen,<br>tollite me, Teucri. quascumque abducite terras:<br>hoc sat erit. scio me Danais e classibus unum<br>et bello Iliacos fateor petiisse penatis.<br>pro quo, si sceleris tanta est iniuria nostri,<br>spargite me in fluctus uastoque immergite ponto;<br>si pereo, hominum manibus periisse iuuabit.'<br>dixerat et genua amplexus genibusque uolutans<br>haerebat. qui sit fari, quo sanguine cretus,<br>hortamur, quae deinde agitet fortuna fateri.<br>ipse pater dextram Anchises haud multa moratus<br>dat iuueni atque animum praesenti pignore firmat.<br>ille haec deposita tandem formidine fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"'I am from an Ithacan home, Achemenides by name, set out for Troy in luckless Ulysses' company; poor was my father Adamastus, and would God fortune had stayed thus! Here my comrades abandoned me in the Cyclops' vast cave, mindless of me while they hurry away from the barbarous gates. It is a house of gore and blood-stained feasts, dim and huge within. Himself he is great of stature and knocks at the lofty sky (gods, take away a curse like this from earth!) to none gracious in aspect or courteous of speech. He feeds on the flesh and dark blood of wretched men. I myself saw, when he caught the bodies of two of us with his great hand, and lying back in the middle of the cave crushed them on the rock, and the courts splashed and swam with gore; I saw when he champed the flesh adrip with dark clots of blood, and the warm limbs quivered under his teeth. Yet not unavenged. Ulysses brooked not this, nor even in such straits did the Ithacan forget himself. For so soon as he, gorged with his feast and buried in wine, lay with bent neck sprawling huge over the cave, in his sleep vomiting gore and gobbets mixed with wine and blood, we, praying to the great gods and with parts allotted, pour at once all round him, and pierce with a sharp weapon the huge eye that lay sunk single under his savage brow, in fashion of an Argolic shield or the lamp of the moon; and at last we exultingly avenge the ghosts of our comrades. But fly, O wretched men, fly and pluck the cable from the beach… For even in the shape and stature of Polyphemus, when he shuts his fleeced flocks and drains their udders in the cave's covert, an hundred other horrible Cyclopes dwell all about this shore and stray on the mountain heights. Thrice now does the horned moon fill out her light, while I linger in life among desolate lairs and haunts of wild beasts in the woodland, and from a rock survey the giant Cyclopes and shudder at their cries and echoing feet. The boughs yield a miserable sustenance, berries and stony sloes, and plants torn up by the root feed me. Sweeping all the view, I at last espied this fleet standing in to shore. On it, whatsoever it were, I cast myself; it is enough to have escaped the accursed tribe. Do you rather, by any death you will, destroy this life of mine.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">'sum patria ex Ithaca, comes infelicis Vlixi,<br>nomine Achaemenides, Troiam genitore Adamasto<br>paupere (mansissetque utinam fortuna!) profectus.<br>hic me, dum trepidi crudelia limina linquunt,<br>immemores socii uasto Cyclopis in antro<br>deseruere. domus sanie dapibusque cruentis,<br>intus opaca, ingens. ipse arduus, altaque pulsat<br>sidera (di talem terris auertite pestem!)<br>nec uisu facilis nec dictu adfabilis ulli;<br>uisceribus miserorum et sanguine uescitur atro.<br>uidi egomet duo de numero cum corpora nostro<br>prensa manu magna medio resupinus in antro<br>frangeret ad saxum, sanieque aspersa natarent<br>limina; uidi atro cum membra fluentia tabo<br>manderet et tepidi tremerent sub dentibus artus—<br>haud impune quidem, nec talia passus Vlixes<br>oblitusue sui est Ithacus discrimine tanto.<br>nam simul expletus dapibus uinoque sepultus<br>ceruicem inflexam posuit, iacuitque per antrum<br>immensus saniem eructans et frusta cruento<br>per somnum commixta mero, nos magna precati<br>numina sortitique uices una undique circum<br>fundimur, et telo lumen terebramus acuto<br>ingens quod torua solum sub fronte latebat,<br>Argolici clipei aut Phoebeae lampadis instar,<br>et tandem laeti sociorum ulciscimur umbras.<br>sed fugite, o miseri, fugite atque ab litore funem<br>rumpite.<br>nam qualis quantusque cauo Polyphemus in antro<br>lanigeras claudit pecudes atque ubera pressat,<br>centum alii curua haec habitant ad litora uulgo<br>infandi Cyclopes et altis montibus errant.<br>tertia iam lunae se cornua lumine complent<br>cum uitam in siluis inter deserta ferarum<br>lustra domosque traho uastosque ab rupe Cyclopas<br>prospicio sonitumque pedum uocemque tremesco.<br>uictum infelicem, bacas lapidosaque corna,<br>dant rami, et uulsis pascunt radicibus herbae.<br>omnia conlustrans hanc primum ad litora classem<br>conspexi uenientem. huic me, quaecumque fuisset,<br>addixi: satis est gentem effugisse nefandam.<br>uos animam hanc potius quocumque absumite leto.'</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Scarcely had he spoken thus, when on the mountain top we see shepherding his flocks a vast moving mass, Polyphemus himself seeking the shores he knew, a horror ominous, shapeless, huge, bereft of sight. A pine lopped by his hand guides and steadies his footsteps. His fleeced sheep attend him, this his single delight and solace in ill… After he hath touched the deep flood and come to the sea, he washes in it the blood that oozes from his eye-socket, grinding his teeth with groans; and now he strides through the sea up to his middle, nor yet does the wave wet his towering sides. We hurry far away in precipitate flight, with the suppliant who had so well merited rescue; and silently cut the cable, and bending forward sweep the sea with emulous oars. He heard, and turned his steps towards the echoing sound. But when he may in no wise lay hands on us, nor can fathom the Ionian waves in pursuit, he raises a vast cry, at which the sea and all his waves shuddered, and the deep land of Italy was startled, and Aetna's vaulted caverns moaned. But the tribe of the Cyclopes, roused from the high wooded hills, run to the harbour and fill the shore. We descry the Aetnean brotherhood standing impotent with scowling eye, their stately heads up to heaven, a dreadful consistory; even as on a mountain summit stand oaks high in air or coned cypresses, a high forest of Jove or covert of Diana. Sharp fear urges us to shake out the sheets in reckless haste, and spread our sails to the favouring wind. Yet Helenus' commands counsel that our course keep not the way between Scylla and Charybdis, the very edge of death on either hand. We are resolved to turn our canvas back. And lo! from the narrow fastness of Pelorus the North wind comes down and reaches us. I sail past Pantagias' mouth with its living stone, the Megarian bay, and low-lying Thapsus. Such names did Achemenides, of luckless Ulysses' company, point out as he retraced his wanderings along the returning shores. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vix ea fatus erat summo cum monte uidemus<br>ipsum inter pecudes uasta se mole mouentem<br>pastorem Polyphemum et litora nota petentem,<br>monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.<br>trunca manum pinus regit et uestigia firmat;<br>lanigerae comitantur oues; ea sola uoluptas<br>solamenque mali.<br>postquam altos tetigit fluctus et ad aequora uenit,<br>luminis effossi fluidum lauit inde cruorem<br>dentibus infrendens gemitu, graditurque per aequor<br>iam medium, necdum fluctus latera ardua tinxit.<br>nos procul inde fugam trepidi celerare recepto<br>supplice sic merito tacitique incidere funem,<br>uertimus et proni certantibus aequora remis.<br>sensit, et ad sonitum uocis uestigia torsit.<br>uerum ubi nulla datur dextra adfectare potestas<br>nec potis Ionios fluctus aequare sequendo,<br>clamorem immensum tollit, quo pontus et omnes<br>intremuere undae, penitusque exterrita tellus<br>Italiae curuisque immugiit Aetna cauernis.<br>at genus e siluis Cyclopum et montibus altis<br>excitum ruit ad portus et litora complent.<br>cernimus astantis nequiquam lumine toruo<br>Aetnaeos fratres caelo capita alta ferentis,<br>concilium horrendum: quales cum uertice celso<br>aeriae quercus aut coniferae cyparissi<br>constiterunt, silua alta Iouis lucusue Dianae.<br>praecipitis metus acer agit quocumque rudentis<br>excutere et uentis intendere uela secundis.<br>contra iussa monent Heleni, Scyllamque Charybdinque<br>inter, utrimque uiam leti discrimine paruo,<br>ni teneam cursus: certum est dare lintea retro.<br>ecce autem Boreas angusta ab sede Pelori<br>missus adest: uiuo praeteruehor ostia saxo<br>Pantagiae Megarosque sinus Thapsumque iacentem.<br>talia monstrabat relegens errata retrorsus<br>litora Achaemenides, comes infelicis Vlixi.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Stretched in front of a bay of Sicily lies an islet over against wavebeat Plemyrium; they of old called it Ortygia. Hither Alpheus the river of Elis, so rumour runs, hath cloven a secret passage beneath the sea, and now through thy well-head, Arethusa, mingles with the Sicilian waves. We adore as bidden the great deities of the ground; and thence I cross the fertile soil of Helorus in the marsh. Next we graze the high reefs and jutting rocks of Pachynus; and far off appears Camarina, forbidden for ever by oracles to move, and the Geloan plains, and vast Gela named after its river. Then Acragas on the steep, once the breeder of noble horses, displays its massive walls in the distance; and with granted breeze I leave thee behind, palm-girt Selinus, and thread the difficult shoals and blind reefs of Lilybaeum. Thereon Drepanum receives me in its haven and joyless border. Here, so many tempestuous seas outgone, alas! my father, the solace of every care and chance, Anchises is lost to me. Here thou, dear lord, abandonest me in weariness, alas! rescued in vain from peril and doom.
