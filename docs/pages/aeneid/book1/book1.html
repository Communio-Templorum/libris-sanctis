Is anger so fierce in celestial spirits? <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,<br>quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus<br>insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores<br>impulerit. Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?</rtc></ruby></p><hr><p><ruby>There was a city of ancient days that Tyrian settlers dwelt in, Carthage, over against Italy and the Tiber mouths afar; rich of store, and mighty in war's fierce pursuits; wherein, they say, alone beyond all other lands had Juno her seat, and held Samos itself less dear. Here was her armour, here her chariot; even now, if fate permit, the goddess strives to nurture it for queen of the nations. Nevertheless she had heard a race was issuing of the blood of Troy, which sometime should overthrow her Tyrian citadel; from it should come a people, lord of lands and tyrannous in war, the destroyer of Libya: so rolled the destinies. Fearful of that, the daughter of Saturn, the old war in her remembrance that she fought at Troy for her beloved Argos long ago,—nor had the springs of her anger nor the bitterness of her vexation yet gone out of mind: deep stored in her soul lies the judgment of Paris, the insult of her slighted beauty, the hated race and the dignities of ravished Ganymede; fired with this also, she tossed all over ocean the Trojan remnant left of the Greek host and merciless Achilles, and held them afar from Latium; and many a year were they wandering driven of fate around all the seas. Such work was it to found the Roman people. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Urbs antiqua fuit, Tyrii tenuere coloni,<br>Karthago, Italiam contra Tiberinaque longe<br>ostia, dives opum studiisque asperrima belli;<br>quam Iuno fertur terris magis omnibus unam<br>posthabita coluisse Samo; hic illius arma,<br>hic currus fuit; hoc regnum dea gentibus esse,<br>si qua fata sinant, iam tum tenditque fovetque.<br>Progeniem sed enim Troiano a sanguine duci<br>audierat, Tyrias olim quae verteret arces;<br>hinc populum late regem belloque superbum<br>venturum excidio Libyae: sic volvere Parcas.<br>Id metuens, veterisque memor Saturnia belli,<br>prima quod ad Troiam pro caris gesserat Argis—<br>necdum etiam causae irarum saevique dolores<br>exciderant animo: manet alta mente repostum<br>iudicium Paridis spretaeque iniuria formae,<br>et genus invisum, et rapti Ganymedis honores.<br>His accensa super, iactatos aequore toto<br>Troas, reliquias Danaum atque immitis Achilli,<br>arcebat longe Latio, multosque per annos<br>errabant, acti fatis, maria omnia circum.<br>Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem!</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Hardly out of sight of the land of Sicily did they set their sails to sea, and merrily upturned the salt foam with brazen prow, when Juno, the undying wound still deep in her heart, thus broke out alone: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vix e conspectu Siculae telluris in altum<br>vela dabant laeti, et spumas salis aere ruebant,<br>cum Iuno, aeternum servans sub pectore volnus,<br>haec secum:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Am I then to abandon my baffled purpose, powerless to keep the <ruby>Teucrian <rtc>Trojan</rtc></ruby> king from Italy? and because fate forbids me? Could Pallas lay the Argive fleet in ashes, and sink the Argives in the sea, for one man's guilt, mad Oïlean Ajax? Her hand darted Jove's flying fire from the clouds, scattered their ships, upturned the seas in tempest; him, his pierced breast yet breathing forth the flame, she caught in a whirlwind and impaled on a spike of rock. But I, who move queen among immortals, I sister and wife of Jove, wage warfare all these years with a single people; and is there any who still adores Juno's divinity, or will kneel to lay sacrifice on her altars?" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Mene incepto desistere victam,<br>nec posse Italia Teucrorum avertere regem?<br>Quippe vetor fatis.

Here in a desolate cavern Aeolus keeps under royal dominion and yokes in dungeon fetters the struggling winds and loud storms. They with mighty moan rage indignant round their mountain barriers. In his lofty citadel Aeolus sits sceptred, assuages their temper and soothes their rage; else would they carry with them seas and lands, and the depth of heaven, and sweep them through space in their flying course. But, fearful of this, the lord omnipotent hath hidden them in caverned gloom, and laid a mountain mass high over them, and appointed them a ruler, who should know by certain law to strain and slacken the reins at command. To him now Juno spoke thus in suppliant accents: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia flammato secum dea corde volutans<br>nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus austris,<br>Aeoliam venit.

Rouse thy winds to fury, and overwhelm their sinking vessels, or drive them asunder and strew ocean with their bodies. Mine are twice seven nymphs of passing loveliness; her who of them all is most excellent in beauty, Deïopea, I will unite to thee in wedlock to be thine for ever; that for this thy service she may fulfil all her years at thy side, and make thee father of a beautiful race." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Aeole, namque tibi divom pater atque hominum rex<br>et mulcere dedit fluctus et tollere vento,<br>gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat aequor,<br>Ilium in Italiam portans victosque Penates:<br>incute vim ventis submersasque obrue puppes,<br>aut age diversos et disiice corpora ponto.<br>Sunt mihi bis septem praestanti corpore nymphae,<br>quarum quae forma pulcherrima Deiopea,<br>conubio iungam stabili propriamque dicabo,<br>omnis ut tecum meritis pro talibus annos<br>exigat, et pulchra faciat te prole parentem."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Aeolus thus returned: "Thine, O queen, the task to search whereto thou hast desire; for me it is right to do thy bidding. From thee have I this poor kingdom, from thee my sceptre and Jove's grace; thou dost grant me to take my seat at the feasts of the gods, and makest me sovereign over clouds and storms." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeolus haec contra: "Tuus, O regina, quid optes<br>explorare labor; mihi iussa capessere fas est.<br>Tu mihi, quodcumque hoc regni, tu sceptra Iovemque<br>concilias, tu das epulis accumbere divom,<br>nimborumque facis tempestatumque potentem."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Even with these words, turning his spear, he struck the side of the hollow hill, and the winds, as in banded array, pour where passage is given them, and cover earth with eddying blasts. East wind and west wind together, and the gusty south-wester, falling prone on the sea, stir it up from its lowest chambers, and roll vast billows to the shore. Behind rises shouting of men and whistling of cordage. In a moment clouds blot sky and daylight from the Teucrians' eyes; black night broods over the deep. Pole thunders to pole, and the air quivers with incessant flashes; all menaces them with instant death. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec ubi dicta, cavum conversa cuspide montem<br>impulit in latus: ac venti, velut agmine facto,<br>qua data porta, ruunt et terras turbine perflant.<br>Incubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis<br>una Eurusque Notusque ruunt creberque procellis<br>Africus, et vastos volvunt ad litora fluctus.<br>Insequitur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum.<br>Eripiunt subito nubes caelumque diemque<br>Teucrorum ex oculis; ponto nox incubat atra.<br>Intonuere poli, et crebris micat ignibus aether,<br>praesentemque viris intentant omnia mortem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Straightway Aeneas' frame grows unnerved and chill, and stretching either hand to heaven, he cries thus aloud: "Ah, thrice and four times happy they who found their doom under high Troy town before their fathers' faces! Ah, son of Tydeus, bravest of the Grecian race, that I could not have fallen on the Ilian plains, and gasped out this my life beneath thine hand! where under the spear of Aeacides lies fierce Hector, lies mighty Sarpedon; where Simoïs so often bore beneath his whirling wave shields and helmets and brave bodies of men." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra:<br>ingemit, et duplicis tendens ad sidera palmas<br>talia voce refert: "O terque quaterque beati,<br>quis ante ora patrum Troiae sub moenibus altis<br>contigit oppetere!

The oars are snapped; the prow swings away and gives her side to the waves; down in a heap comes a broken mountain of water. These hang on the wave's ridge; to these the yawning billow shows ground amid the surge, where the sea churns with sand. Three ships the south wind catches and hurls on hidden rocks, rocks amid the waves which Italians call the Altars, a vast reef banking the sea. Three the east forces from the deep into shallows and quicksands, piteous to see, dashes on shoals and girdles with a sandbank. One, wherein loyal Orontes and his Lycians rode, before their lord's eyes a vast sea descending strikes astern. The helmsman is dashed away and rolled forward headlong; her as she lies the billow sends spinning thrice round with it, and engulfs in the swift whirl. Scattered swimmers appear in the vast eddy, armour of men, timbers and Trojan treasure amid the water. Ere now the stout ship of Ilioneus, ere now of brave Achates, and she wherein Abas rode, and she wherein aged Aletes, have yielded to the storm; through the shaken fastenings of their sides they all draw in the deadly water, and their opening seams give way. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia iactanti stridens Aquilone procella<br>velum adversa ferit, fluctusque ad sidera tollit.<br>Franguntur remi; tum prora avertit, et undis<br>dat latus; insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons.<br>Hi summo in flucta pendent; his unda dehiscens<br>terram inter fluctus aperit; furit aestus harenis.<br>Tris Notus abreptas in saxa latentia torquet—<br>saxa vocant Itali mediis quae in fluctibus aras—<br>dorsum immane mari summo; tris Eurus ab alto<br>in brevia et Syrtis urguet, miserabile visu,<br>inliditque vadis atque aggere cingit harenae.<br>Unam, quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten,<br>ipsius ante oculos ingens a vertice pontus<br>in puppim ferit: excutitur pronusque magister<br>volvitur in caput; ast illam ter fluctus ibidem<br>torquet agens circum, et rapidus vorat aequore vortex.<br>Adparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto,<br>arma virum, tabulaeque, et Troia gaza per undas.<br>Iam validam Ilionei navem, iam fortis Achati,<br>et qua vectus Abas, et qua grandaevus Aletes,<br>vicit hiems; laxis laterum compagibus omnes<br>accipiunt inimicum imbrem, rimisque fatiscunt.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile Neptune discerned with astonishment the loud roaring of the vexed sea, the tempest let loose from prison, and the still water boiling up from its depths, and lifting his head calm above the waves, looked forth across the deep. He sees all ocean strewn with Aeneas' fleet, the Trojans overwhelmed by the waves and the ruining heaven. Juno's guile and wrath lay clear to her brother's eye; east wind and west he calls before him, and thereon speaks thus: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Interea magno misceri murmure pontum,<br>emissamque hiemem sensit Neptunus, et imis<br>stagna refusa vadis, graviter commotus; et alto<br>prospiciens, summa placidum caput extulit unda.<br>Disiectam Aeneae, toto videt aequore classem,<br>fluctibus oppressos Troas caelique ruina,<br>nec latuere doli fratrem Iunonis et irae.<br>Eurum ad se Zephyrumque vocat, dehinc talia fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Stand you then so sure in your confidence of birth? Careless, O winds, of my deity, dare you confound sky and earth, and raise so huge a coil? you whom I—But better to still the aroused waves; for a second sin you shall pay me another penalty. Speed your flight, and say this to your king: not to him but to me was allotted the stern trident of ocean empire. His fastness is on the monstrous rocks where thou and thine, east wind, dwell: there let Aeolus glory in his palace and reign over the barred prison of his winds." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Tantane vos generis tenuit fiducia vestri?<br>Iam caelum terramque meo sine numine, venti,<br>miscere, et tantas audetis tollere moles?<br>Quos ego—sed motos praestat componere fluctus.<br>Post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis.<br>Maturate fugam, regique haec dicite vestro:<br>non illi imperium pelagi saevumque tridentem,<br>sed mihi sorte datum. Tenet ille immania saxa,<br>vestras, Eure, domos; illa se iactet in aula<br>Aeolus, et clauso ventorum carcere regnet."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus he speaks, and ere the words are done he soothes the swollen seas, chases away the gathered clouds, and restores the sunlight. Cymothoë and Triton together push the ships strongly off the sharp reef; himself he eases them with his trident, channels the vast quicksands, and assuages the sea, gliding on light wheels along the water. Even as when oft in a throng of people strife hath risen, and the base multitude rage in their minds, and now brands and stones are flying; madness lends arms; then if perchance they catch sight of one reverend for goodness and service, they are silent and stand by with attentive ear; he with speech sways their temper and soothes their breasts; even so hath fallen all the thunder of ocean, when riding forward beneath a cloudless sky the lord of the sea wheels his coursers and lets his gliding chariot fly with loosened rein. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Sic ait, et dicto citius tumida aequora placat,<br>collectasque fugat nubes, solemque reducit.<br>Cymothoe simul et Triton adnixus acuto<br>detrudunt navis scopulo; levat ipse tridenti;<br>et vastas aperit syrtis, et temperat aequor,<br>atque rotis summas levibus perlabitur undas.<br>Ac veluti magno in populo cum saepe coorta est<br>seditio, saevitque animis ignobile volgus,<br>iamque faces et saxa volant—furor arma ministrat;<br>tum, pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem<br>conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant;<br>ille regit dictis animos, et pectora mulcet,—<br>sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, aequora postquam<br>prospiciens genitor caeloque invectus aperto<br>flectit equos, curruque volans dat lora secundo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The outworn Aeneadae hasten to run for the nearest shore, and turn to the coast of Libya. There lies a spot deep withdrawn; an island forms a harbour with outstretched sides, whereon all the waves break from the open sea and part into the hollows of the bay. On this side and that enormous cliffs rise threatening heaven, and twin crags beneath whose crest the sheltered water lies wide and calm; above hangs a background of flickering forest, and the dark shade of rustling groves. Beneath the seaward brow is a rock-hung cavern, within it fresh springs and seats in the living stone, a haunt of nymphs; where tired ships need no fetters to hold nor anchor to fasten them with crooked bite. Here with seven sail gathered of all his company Aeneas enters; and disembarking on the land of their desire the Trojans gain the chosen beach, and set their feet dripping with brine upon the shore. At once Achates struck a spark from the flint and caught the fire on leaves, and laying dry fuel round kindled it into flame. Then, weary of fortune, they fetch out corn spoiled by the sea and weapons of corn-dressing, and begin to parch over the fire and bruise in stones the grain they had rescued. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Defessi Aeneadae, quae proxima litora, cursu<br>contendunt petere, et Libyae vertuntur ad oras.<br>Est in secessu longo locus: insula portum<br>efficit obiectu laterum, quibus omnis ab alto<br>frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos.<br>Hinc atque hinc vastae rupes geminique minantur<br>in caelum scopuli, quorum sub vertice late<br>aequora tuta silent; tum silvis scaena coruscis<br>desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra.<br>Fronte sub adversa scopulis pendentibus antrum,<br>intus aquae dulces vivoque sedilia saxo,<br>nympharum domus: hic fessas non vincula navis<br>ulla tenent, unco non alligat ancora morsu.<br>Huc septem Aeneas collectis navibus omni<br>ex numero subit; ac magno telluris amore<br>egressi optata potiuntur Troes harena,<br>et sale tabentis artus in litore ponunt.<br>Ac primum silici scintillam excudit Achates,<br>succepitque ignem foliis, atque arida circum<br>nutrimenta dedit, rapuitque in fomite flammam.<br>Tum Cererem corruptam undis Cerealiaque arma<br>expediunt fessi rerum, frugesque receptas<br>et torrere parant flammis et frangere saxo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Meanwhile Aeneas scales the crag, and seeks the whole view wide over ocean, if he may see aught of Antheus storm-tossed with his Phrygian galleys, aught of Capys or of Caïcus' armour high astern. Ship in sight is none; three stags he espies straying on the shore; behind whole herds follow, and graze in long train across the valley. Stopping short, he snatched up a bow and swift arrows, the arms trusty Achates was carrying; and first the leaders, their stately heads high with branching antlers, then the common herd fall to his hand, as he drives them with his shafts in a broken crowd through the leafy woods. Nor stays he till seven great victims are stretched on the sod, fulfilling the number of his ships. Thence he seeks the harbour and parts them among all his company. The casks of wine that good Acestes had filled on the Trinacrian beach, the hero's gift at their departure, he thereafter shares, and calms with speech their sorrowing hearts: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeneas scopulum interea conscendit, et omnem<br>prospectum late pelago petit, Anthea si quem<br>iactatum vento videat Phrygiasque biremis,<br>aut Capyn, aut celsis in puppibus arma Caici.<br>Navem in conspectu nullam, tris litore cervos<br>prospicit errantis; hos tota armenta sequuntur<br>a tergo, et longum per vallis pascitur agmen.<br>Constitit hic, arcumque manu celerisque sagittas<br>corripuit, fidus quae tela gerebat Achates;<br>ductoresque ipsos primum, capita alta ferentis<br>cornibus arboreis, sternit, tum volgus, et omnem<br>miscet agens telis nemora inter frondea turbam;<br>nec prius absistit, quam septem ingentia victor<br>corpora fundat humi, et numerum cum navibus aequet.<br>Hinc portum petit, et socios partitur in omnes.<br>Vina bonus quae deinde cadis onerarat Acestes<br>litore Trinacrio dederatque abeuntibus heros,<br>dividit, et dictis maerentia pectora mulcet:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"O comrades, for not now nor aforetime are we ignorant of ill, O tried by heavier fortunes, unto this last likewise will God appoint an end. The fury of Scylla and the roaring recesses of her crags you have been anigh; the rocks of the Cyclops you have trodden. Recall your courage, put dull fear away. This too sometime we shall haply remember with delight. Through chequered fortunes, through many perilous ways, we steer for Latium, where destiny points us a quiet home. There the realm of Troy may rise again unforbidden. Keep heart, and endure till prosperous fortune come." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"O socii—neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum—<br>O passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem.<br>Vos et Scyllaeam rabiem penitusque sonantis<br>accestis scopulos, vos et Cyclopea saxa<br>experti: revocate animos, maestumque timorem<br>mittite: forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit.<br>Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum<br>tendimus in Latium; sedes ubi fata quietas<br>ostendunt; illic fas regna resurgere Troiae.<br>Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Such words he utters, and sick with deep distress he feigns hope on his face, and keeps his anguish hidden deep in his breast. The others set to the spoil they are to feast upon, tear chine from ribs and lay bare the flesh; some cut it into pieces and pierce it still quivering with spits; others plant cauldrons on the beach and feed them with flame. Then they repair their strength with food, and lying along the grass take their fill of old wine and fat venison. After hunger is driven from the banquet, and the board cleared, they talk with lingering regret of their lost companions, swaying between hope and fear, whether they may believe them yet alive, or now in their last agony and deaf to mortal call. Most does good Aeneas inly wail the loss now of valiant Orontes, now of Amycus, the cruel doom of Lycus, of brave Gyas, and brave Cloanthus. And now they ceased; when from the height of air Jupiter looked down on the sail-winged sea and outspread lands, the shores and broad countries, and looking stood on the cope of heaven, and cast down his eyes on the realm of Libya. To him thus troubled at heart Venus, her bright eyes brimming with tears, sorrowfully speaks: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia voce refert, curisque ingentibus aeger<br>spem voltu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem.<br>Illi se praedae accingunt, dapibusque futuris;<br>tergora deripiunt costis et viscera nudant;<br>pars in frusta secant veribusque trementia figunt;<br>litore aena locant alii, flammasque ministrant.<br>Tum victu revocant vires, fusique per herbam<br>implentur veteris Bacchi pinguisque ferinae.<br>Postquam exempta fames epulis mensaeque remotae,<br>amissos longo socios sermone requirunt,<br>spemque metumque inter dubii, seu vivere credant,<br>sive extrema pati nec iam exaudire vocatos.<br>Praecipue pius Aeneas nunc acris Oronti,<br>nunc Amyci casum gemit et crudelia secum<br>fata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"O thou who dost sway mortal and immortal things with eternal command and the terror of thy thunderbolt, how can my Aeneas have transgressed so grievously against thee? how his Trojans? on whom, after so many deaths outgone, all the world is barred for Italy's sake. From them sometime in the rolling years the Romans were to arise indeed; from them were to be rulers who, renewing the blood of Teucer, should hold sea and land in universal lordship. This thou didst promise: why, O father, is thy decree reversed? This was my solace for the wretched ruin of sunken Troy, doom balanced against doom. Now so many woes are spent, and the same fortune still pursues them; Lord and King, what limit dost thou set to their agony? Antenor could elude the encircling Achaeans, could thread in safety the Illyrian bays and inmost realms of the Liburnians, could climb Timavus' source, whence through nine mouths pours the bursting tide amid dreary moans of the mountain, and covers the fields with hoarse waters. Yet here did he set Patavium town, a dwelling-place for his Teucrians, gave his name to a nation and hung up the armour of Troy; now settled in peace, he rests and is in quiet. We, thy children, we whom thou beckonest to the heights of heaven, our fleet miserably cast away for a single enemy's anger, are betrayed and severed far from the Italian coasts. Is this the reward of goodness? Is it thus thou dost restore our throne?" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Et iam finis erat, cum Iuppiter aethere summo<br>despiciens mare velivolum terrasque iacentis<br>litoraque et latos populos, sic vertice caeli<br>constitit, et Libyae defixit lumina regnis.<br>Atque illum talis iactantem pectore curas<br>tristior et lacrimis oculos suffusa nitentis<br>adloquitur Venus: "O qui res hominumque deumque<br>aeternis regis imperiis, et fulmine terres,<br>quid meus Aeneas in te committere tantum,<br>quid Troes potuere, quibus, tot funera passis,<br>cunctus ob Italiam terrarum clauditur orbis?<br>Certe hinc Romanos olim, volventibus annis,<br>hinc fore ductores, revocato a sanguine Teucri,<br>qui mare, qui terras omni dicione tenerent,<br>pollicitus, quae te, genitor, sententia vertit?<br>Hoc equidem occasum Troiae tristisque ruinas<br>solabar, fatis contraria fata rependens;<br>nunc eadem fortuna viros tot casibus actos<br>insequitur.

But the boy Ascanius, whose surname is now Iülus—Ilus he was while the Ilian state stood sovereign—thirty great circles of rolling months shall he fulfil in government; he shall carry the kingdom from its fastness in Lavinium, and make a strong fortress of Alba the Long. Here the full space of thrice an hundred years shall the kingdom endure under the race of Hector's kin, till the royal priestess Ilia from Mars' embrace shall give birth to a twin progeny. Thence shall Romulus, gay in the tawny hide of the she-wolf that nursed him, take up their line, and name them Romans after his own name. I appoint to these neither period nor boundary of empire: I have given them dominion without end. Nay, harsh Juno, who in her fear now troubles earth and sea and sky, shall change to better counsels, and with me shall cherish the lords of the world, the gowned race of Rome. Thus is it willed. A day will come in the lapse of cycles, when the house of Assaracus shall lay Phthia and famed Mycenae in bondage, and reign over conquered Argos. From the fair line of Troy a Caesar shall arise, who shall limit his empire with ocean, his glory with the firmament, Julius, inheritor of great Iülus' name. Him one day, thy care done, thou shalt welcome to heaven loaded with Eastern spoils; to him too shall vows be addressed. Then shall war cease, and the iron ages soften. Hoar Faith and Vesta, Quirinus and Remus brothers again, shall deliver statutes. The dreadful steel-riveted gates of war shall be shut fast; on murderous weapons the inhuman Fury, his hands bound behind him with an hundred fetters of brass, shall sit within, shrieking with terrible blood-stained lips." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Parce metu, Cytherea: manent immota tuorum<br>fata tibi; cernes urbem et promissa Lavini<br>moenia, sublimemque feres ad sidera caeli<br>magnanimum Aenean; neque me sententia vertit.<br>Hic tibi (fabor enim, quando haec te cura remordet,<br>longius et volvens fatorum arcana movebo)<br>bellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces<br>contundet, moresque viris et moenia ponet,<br>tertia dum Latio regnantem viderit aestas,<br>ternaque transierint Rutulis hiberna subactis.<br>At puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen Iulo<br>additur,—Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno,—<br>triginta magnos volvendis mensibus orbis<br>imperio explebit, regnumque ab sede Lavini<br>transferet, et longam multa vi muniet Albam.<br>Hic iam ter centum totos regnabitur annos<br>gente sub Hectorea, donec regina sacerdos,<br>Marte gravis, geminam partu dabit Ilia prolem.<br>Inde lupae fulvo nutricis tegmine laetus<br>Romulus excipiet gentem, et Mavortia condet<br>moenia, Romanosque suo de nomine dicet.<br>His ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono;<br>imperium sine fine dedi.

But the kingdom of Tyre was in her brother Pygmalion's hands, a monster of guilt unparalleled. Between these madness came; the unnatural brother, blind with lust of gold, and reckless of his sister's love, lays Sychaeus low before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon; and for long he hid the deed, and by many a crafty pretence cheated her love-sickness with hollow hope. But in slumber came the very ghost of her unburied husband; lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless altars and his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove all the blind web of household guilt. Then he counsels hasty flight out of the country, and to aid her passage discloses treasures long hidden underground, an untold mass of silver and gold. Stirred thereby, Dido gathered a company for flight. All assemble in whom hatred of the tyrant was relentless or fear keen; they seize on ships that chanced to lie ready, and load them with the gold. Pygmalion's hoarded wealth is borne overseas; a woman leads the work. They came at last to the land where thou wilt descry a city now great, New Carthage, and her rising citadel, and bought ground, called thence Byrsa, as much as a bull's hide would encircle.

Aeneas marvels at the mass of building, pastoral huts once of old, marvels at the gateways and clatter of the pavements. The Tyrians are hot at work to trace the walls, to rear the citadel, and roll up great stones by hand, or to choose a spot for their dwelling and enclose it with a furrow. They ordain justice and magistrates, and the august senate. Here some are digging harbours, here others lay the deep foundations of their theatre, and hew out of the cliff vast columns, the lofty ornaments of the stage to be: even as bees when summer is fresh over the flowery country ply their task beneath the sun, when they lead forth their nation's grown brood, or when they press the liquid honey and strain their cells with nectarous sweets, or relieve the loaded incomers, or in banded array drive the idle herd of drones far from their folds; they swarm over their work, and the odorous honey smells sweet of thyme. "Happy they whose city already rises!" cries Aeneas, looking on the town roofs below. Girt in the cloud he passes amid them, wonderful to tell, and mingling with the throng is descried of none. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Corripuere viam interea, qua semita monstrat.<br>Iamque ascendebant collem, qui plurimus urbi<br>imminet, adversasque adspectat desuper arces.<br>Miratur molem Aeneas, magalia quondam,<br>miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum.<br>Instant ardentes Tyrii pars ducere muros,<br>molirique arcem et manibus subvolvere saxa,<br>pars optare locum tecto et concludere sulco.<br>[Iura magistratusque legunt sanctumque senatum;]<br>hic portus alii effodiunt; hic alta theatris<br>fundamenta locant alii, immanisque columnas<br>rupibus excidunt, scaenis decora alta futuris.<br>Qualis apes aestate nova per florea rura<br>exercet sub sole labor, cum gentis adultos<br>educunt fetus, aut cum liquentia mella<br>stipant et dulci distendunt nectare cellas,<br>aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto<br>ignavom fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent:<br>fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.<br>"O fortunati, quorum iam moenia surgunt!"<br>Aeneas ait, et fastigia suspicit urbis.<br>Infert se saeptus nebula, mirabile dictu,<br>per medios, miscetque viris, neque cernitur ulli.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>In the heart of the town was a grove deep with luxuriant shade, wherein first the Phoenicians, buffeted by wave and whirlwind, dug up the token Queen Juno had appointed, the head of a war horse: thereby was their race to be through all ages illustrious in war and opulent in living. Here to Juno was Sidonian Dido founding a vast temple, rich with offerings and the sanctity of her godhead: brazen steps rose on the threshold, brass clamped the pilasters, doors of brass swung on grating hinges. First in this grove did a strange chance meet his steps and allay his fears; first here did Aeneas dare to hope for safety and have fairer trust in his shattered fortunes. For while he closely scans the temple that towers above him, while, awaiting the queen, he admires the fortunate city, the emulous hands and elaborate work of her craftsmen, he sees ranged in order the battles of Ilium, that war whose fame was already rumoured through all the world, the sons of Atreus and Priam, and Achilles whom both found pitiless. He stopped and cried weeping, "What land is left, Achates, what tract on earth that is not full of our agony? Behold Priam!

Not far away he knows the snowy canvas of Rhesus' tents, which, betrayed in their first sleep, the blood-stained son of Tydeus laid desolate in heaped slaughter, and turns the ruddy steeds away to the camp ere ever they tasted Trojan fodder or drunk of Xanthus. Elsewhere Troïlus, his armour flung away in flight—luckless boy, no match for Achilles to meet!—is borne along by his horses, and thrown back entangled with his empty chariot, still clutching the reins; his neck and hair are dragged over the ground, and his reversed spear scores the dust. Meanwhile the Ilian women went with disordered tresses to unfriendly Pallas' temple, and bore the votive garment, sadly beating breast with palm: the goddess turning away held her eyes fast on the ground. Thrice had Achilles whirled Hector round the walls of Troy, and was selling the lifeless body for gold; then at last he heaves a loud and heart-deep groan, as the spoils, as the chariot, as the dear body met his gaze, and Priam outstretching unarmed hands. Himself too he knew joining battle with the foremost Achaeans, knew the Eastern ranks and swart Memnon's armour. Penthesilea leads her crescent-shielded Amazonian columns in furious heat with thousands around her; clasping a golden belt under her naked breast, the warrior maiden clashes boldly with men. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Namque videbat, uti bellantes Pergama circum<br>hac fugerent Graii, premeret Troiana iuventus,<br>hac Phryges, instaret curru cristatus Achilles.<br>Nec procul hinc Rhesi niveis tentoria velis<br>adgnoscit lacrimans, primo quae prodita somno<br>Tydides multa vastabat caede cruentus,<br>ardentisque avertit equos in castra, prius quam<br>pabula gustassent Troiae Xanthumque bibissent.<br>Parte alia fugiens amissis Troilus armis,<br>infelix puer atque impar congressus Achilli,<br>fertur equis, curruque haeret resupinus inani,<br>lora tenens tamen; huic cervixque comaeque trahuntur<br>per terram, et versa pulvis inscribitur hasta.<br>Interea ad templum non aequae Palladis ibant<br>crinibus Iliades passis peplumque ferebant,<br>suppliciter tristes et tunsae pectora palmis;<br>diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat.<br>Ter circum Iliacos raptaverat Hectora muros,<br>exanimumque auro corpus vendebat Achilles.<br>Tum vero ingentem gemitum dat pectore ab imo,<br>ut spolia, ut currus, utque ipsum corpus amici,<br>tendentemque manus Priamum conspexit inermis.<br>Se quoque principibus permixtum adgnovit Achivis,<br>Eoasque acies et nigri Memnonis arma.<br>Ducit Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis<br>Penthesilea furens, mediisque in milibus ardet,<br>aurea subnectens exsertae cingula mammae,<br>bellatrix, audetque viris concurrere virgo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>While these marvels meet Dardanian Aeneas' eyes, while he dizzily hangs rapt in one long gaze, Dido the queen entered the precinct, beautiful exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas' banks or along the Cynthian ridges Diana wheels the dance, while behind her a thousand mountain nymphs crowd to left and right; she carries quiver on shoulder, and as she moves outshines them all in deity; Latona's heart is thrilled with silent joy; such was Dido, so she joyously advanced amid the throng, urging on the business of her rising empire. Then in the gates of the goddess, beneath the central vault of the temple roof, she took her seat girt with arms and high enthroned. And now she gave justice and laws to her people, and adjusted or allotted their taskwork in due portion; when suddenly Aeneas sees advancing with a great crowd about them Antheus and Sergestus and brave Cloanthus, and other of his Trojans, whom the black squall had sundered at sea and borne far away on the coast. Dizzy with the shock of joy and fear he and Achates together were on fire with eagerness to clasp their hands; but in confused uncertainty they keep hidden, and clothed in the sheltering cloud wait to espy what fortune befalls them, where they are leaving their fleet ashore, why they now come; for they advanced, chosen men from all the ships, praying for grace, and held on with loud cries towards the temple. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Haec dum Dardanio Aeneae miranda videntur,<br>dum stupet, obtutuque haeret defixus in uno,<br>regina ad templum, forma pulcherrima Dido,<br>incessit magna iuvenum stipante caterva.<br>Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per iuga Cynthi<br>exercet Diana choros, quam mille secutae<br>hinc atque hinc glomerantur oreades; illa pharetram<br>fert umero, gradiensque deas supereminet omnis:<br>Latonae tacitum pertemptant gaudia pectus:<br>talis erat Dido, talem se laeta ferebat<br>per medios, instans operi regnisque futuris.<br>Tum foribus divae, media testudine templi,<br>saepta armis, solioque alte subnixa resedit.<br>Iura dabat legesque viris, operumque laborem<br>partibus aequabat iustis, aut sorte trahebat:<br>cum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno<br>Anthea Sergestumque videt fortemque Cloanthum,<br>Teucrorumque alios, ater quos aequore turbo<br>dispulerat penitusque alias avexerat oras.<br>Obstipuit simul ipse simul perculsus Achates<br>laetitiaque metuque; avidi coniungere dextras<br>ardebant; sed res animos incognita turbat.<br>Dissimulant, et nube cava speculantur amicti,<br>quae fortuna viris, classem quo litore linquant,<br>quid veniant; cunctis nam lecti navibus ibant,<br>orantes veniam, et templum clamore petebant.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>After they entered in, and free speech was granted, aged Ilioneus with placid mien thus began: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postquam introgressi et coram data copia fandi,<br>maximus Ilioneus placido sic pectore coepit:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Queen, to whom Jupiter hath given to found this new city, and lay the yoke of justice upon haughty tribes, we beseech thee, we wretched Trojans storm-driven over all the seas, stay the dreadful flames from our ships; spare a guiltless race, and bend a gracious regard on our fortunes.

There is a place Greeks name Hesperia, an ancient land, mighty in arms and foison of the clod; Oenotrian men dwelt therein; now rumour is that a younger race from their captain's name have called it Italy.

The gods grant thee worthy reward, if their deity turn any regard on goodness, if aught avails justice and conscious purity of soul.

While rivers run into the sea, while the mountain shadows move across their slopes, while the stars have pasturage in heaven, ever shall thine honour, thy name and praises endure in the unknown lands that summon me."

From that time forth have I known the fall of the Trojan city, known thy name and the Pelasgian princes. Their very foe would extol the Teucrians with highest praises, and boasted himself a branch of the ancient Teucrian stem. Come therefore, O men, and enter our house.

Presents likewise he bids him bring saved from the wreck of Ilium, a mantle stiff with gold embroidery, and a veil with woven border of yellow acanthus-flower, that once decked Helen of Argos, the marvel of her mother Leda's giving; Helen had borne them from Mycenae, when she sought Troy towers and a lawless bridal; the sceptre too that Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter, once had worn, a beaded necklace, and a double circlet of jewelled gold. Achates, hasting on his message, bent his way towards the ships. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Aeneas (neque enim patrius consistere mentem<br>passus amor) rapidum ad navis praemittit Achaten,<br>Ascanio ferat haec, ipsumque ad moenia ducat;<br>omnis in Ascanio cari stat cura parentis.<br>Munera praeterea, Iliacis erepta ruinis,<br>ferre iubet, pallam signis auroque rigentem,<br>et circumtextum croceo velamen acantho,<br>ornatus Argivae Helenae, quos illa Mycenis,<br>Pergama cum peteret inconcessosque hymenaeos,<br>extulerat, matris Ledae mirabile donum:<br>praeterea sceptrum, Ilione quod gesserat olim,<br>maxima natarum Priami, colloque monile<br>bacatum, et duplicem gemmis auroque coronam.<br>Haec celerans ita ad naves tendebat Achates.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But in the Cytherean's breast new arts, new schemes revolve; if Cupid, changed in form and feature, may come in sweet Ascanius' room, and his gifts kindle the queen to madness and set her inmost sense aflame. Verily she fears the uncertain house, the double-tongued race of Tyre; cruel Juno frets her, and at nightfall her care floods back. Therefore to winged Love she speaks these words: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">At Cytherea novas artes, nova pectore versat<br>Consilia, ut faciem mutatus et ora Cupido<br>pro dulci Ascanio veniat, donisque furentem<br>incendat reginam, atque ossibus implicet ignem;<br>quippe domum timet ambiguam Tyriosque bilinguis;<br>urit atrox Iuno, et sub noctem cura recursat.<br>Ergo his aligerum dictis adfatur Amorem:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Son, who art alone my strength and sovereignty, son, who scornest the mighty father's Typhoïan shafts, to thee I fly for succour, and sue humbly to thy deity. How Aeneas thy brother is driven about all the sea-coasts by bitter Juno's malignity, this thou knowest, and hast often grieved in our grief. Now Dido the Phoenician holds him stayed with soft words, and I tremble to think how the welcome of Juno's house may issue; she will not be idle in this supreme turn of fortune. Wherefore I counsel to prevent her wiles and circle the queen with flame, that, unalterable by any deity, she may be held fast to me by passionate love for Aeneas. Take now my thought how to do this. The boy prince, my chiefest care, makes ready at his dear father's summons to go to the Sidonian city, carrying gifts that survive the sea and the flames of Troy. Him will I hide deep asleep in my holy habitation, high on Cythera's hills or in Idalium, that he may not know nor cross our wiles. Do thou but for one night feign his form, and, boy as thou art, put on the familiar face of a boy; so when in festal cheer, amid royal dainties and Bacchic juice, Dido shall take thee to her lap, shall fold thee in her clasp and kiss thee close and sweet, thou mayest imbreathe a hidden fire and unsuspected poison." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Nate, meae vires, mea magna potentia solus,<br>nate, patris summi qui tela Typhoia temnis,<br>ad te confugio et supplex tua numina posco.<br>Frater ut Aeneas pelago tuus omnia circum<br>litora iactetur odiis Iunonis iniquae,<br>nota tibi, et nostro doluisti saepe dolore.<br>Hunc Phoenissa tenet Dido blandisque moratur<br>vocibus; et vereor, quo se Iunonia vertant<br>hospitia; haud tanto cessabit cardine rerum.<br>Quocirca capere ante dolis et cingere flamma<br>reginam meditor, ne quo se numine mutet,<br>sed magno Aeneae mecum teneatur amore.<br>Qua facere id possis, nostram nunc accipe mentem.<br>Regius accitu cari genitoris ad urbem<br>Sidoniam puer ire parat, mea maxima cura,<br>dona ferens, pelago et flammis restantia Troiae:<br>hunc ego sopitum somno super alta Cythera<br>aut super Idalium sacrata sede recondam,<br>ne qua scire dolos mediusve occurrere possit.<br>Tu faciem illius noctem non amplius unam<br>falle dolo, et notos pueri puer indue voltus,<br>ut, cum te gremio accipiet laetissima Dido<br>regalis inter mensas laticemque Lyaeum,<br>cum dabit amplexus atque oscula dulcia figet,<br>occultum inspires ignem fallasque veneno."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Love obeys his dear mother's words, lays by his wings, and walks rejoicingly with Iülus' tread. But Venus pours gentle dew of slumber on Ascanius' limbs, and lifts him lulled in her lap to the tall Idalian groves of her deity, where soft amaracus folds him round with the shadowed sweetness of its odorous blossoms. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Paret Amor dictis carae genetricis, et alas<br>exuit, et gressu gaudens incedit Iuli.<br>At Venus Ascanio placidam per membra quietem<br>inrigat, et fotum gremio dea tollit in altos<br>Idaliae lucos, ubi mollis amaracus illum<br>floribus et dulci adspirans complectitur umbra.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And now, obedient to her words, Cupid went merrily in Achates' guiding, with the royal gifts for the Tyrians. Already at his coming the queen hath sate her down in the midmost on her golden throne under the splendid tapestries; now lord Aeneas, now too the men of Troy gather, and all recline on the strewn purple. Servants pour water on their hands, serve corn from baskets, and bring napkins with close-cut pile. Fifty handmaids are within, whose task is in their course to keep unfailing store and kindle the household fire. An hundred others, and as many pages all of like age, load the board with food and array the wine cups. Therewithal the Tyrians are gathered full in the wide feasting chamber, and take their appointed places on the broidered cushions. They marvel at Aeneas' gifts, marvel at Iülus, at the god's face aflame and forged speech, at the mantle and veil wrought with yellow acanthus-flower. Above all the hapless Phoenician, victim to coming doom, cannot satiate her soul, but, stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire. He, when hanging clasped on Aeneas' neck he had satisfied all the deluded parent's love, makes his way to the queen; the queen clings to him with her eyes and all her soul, and ever and anon fondles him in her lap, ah, poor Dido! witless how mighty a deity sinks into her breast; but he, mindful of his mother the Acidalian, begins touch by touch to efface Sychaeus, and sows the surprise of a living love in the long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Iamque ibat dicto parens et dona Cupido<br>regia portabat Tyriis, duce laetus Achate.<br>Cum venit, aulaeis iam se regina superbis<br>aurea composuit sponda mediamque locavit.<br>Iam pater Aeneas et iam Troiana iuventus<br>conveniunt, stratoque super discumbitur ostro.<br>Dant famuli manibus lymphas, Cereremque canistris<br>expediunt, tonsisque ferunt mantelia villis.<br>Quinquaginta intus famulae, quibus ordine longam<br>cura penum struere, et flammis adolere Penatis;<br>centum aliae totidemque pares aetate ministri,<br>qui dapibus mensas onerent et pocula ponant.<br>Nec non et Tyrii per limina laeta frequentes<br>convenere, toris iussi discumbere pictis.<br>Mirantur dona Aeneae, mirantur Iulum<br>flagrantisque dei voltus simulataque verba,<br>[pallamque et pictum croceo velamen acantho.]<br>Praecipue infelix, pesti devota futurae,<br>expleri mentem nequit ardescitque tuendo<br>Phoenissa, et pariter puero donisque movetur.<br>Ille ubi complexu Aeneae colloque pependit<br>et magnum falsi implevit genitoris amorem,<br>reginam petit haec oculis, haec pectore toto<br>haeret et interdum gremio fovet, inscia Dido,<br>insidat quantus miserae deus; at memor ille<br>matris Acidaliae paulatim abolere Sychaeum<br>incipit, et vivo temptat praevertere amore<br>iam pridem resides animos desuetaque corda.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Soon as the noise of banquet ceased and the board was cleared, they set down great bowls and enwreathe the wine. The house is filled with hum of voices eddying through the spacious chambers; lit lamps hang down by golden chainwork, and flaming tapers expel the night. Now the queen called for a heavy cup of jewelled gold, and filled it with pure wine; therewith was the use of Belus and all of Belus' race: then the hall was silenced. "Jupiter," she cries, "for thou art reputed lawgiver of hospitality, grant that this be a joyful day to the Tyrians and the voyagers from Troy, a day to live in our children's memory. Bacchus, the giver of gladness, be with us, and Juno the bountiful; and you, O Tyrians, be favourable to our assembly." She spoke, and poured liquid libation on the board, which done, she first herself touched it lightly with her lips, then handed it to Bitias and bade him speed; he valiantly drained the foaming cup, and flooded him with the brimming gold. The other princes followed. Long-haired Iopas on his gilded lyre fills the chamber with songs ancient Atlas taught; he sings of the wandering moon and the sun's travails; whence is the human race and the brute, whence water and fire; of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, and the twin Oxen; why wintry suns make such haste to dip in ocean, or what delay makes the nights drag lingeringly. Tyrians and Trojans after them redouble applause. Therewithal Dido wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long draughts of love, asking many a thing of Priam, many a thing of Hector; now in what armour the son of the Morning came; now of what fashion were Diomede's horses; now of mighty Achilles. "Nay, come," she cries, "tell to us, O guest, from their first beginning the treachery of the Grecians, thy people's woes, and thine own wanderings; for this is now the seventh summer that bears thee a wanderer over all the earth and sea." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Postquam prima quies epulis, mensaeque remotae,<br>crateras magnos statuunt et vina coronant.<br>Fit strepitus tectis, vocemque per ampla volutant<br>atria; dependent lychni laquearibus aureis<br>incensi, et noctem flammis funalia vincunt.<br>Hic regina gravem gemmis auroque poposcit<br>implevitque mero pateram, quam Belus et omnes<br>a Belo soliti; tum facta silentia tectis:<br>"Iuppiter, hospitibus nam te dare iura loquuntur,<br>hunc laetum Tyriisque diem Troiaque profectis<br>esse velis, nostrosque huius meminisse minores.<br>Adsit laetitiae Bacchus dator, et bona Iuno;<br>et vos, O, coetum, Tyrii, celebrate faventes."<br>Dixit, et in mensam laticum libavit honorem,<br>primaque, libato, summo tenus attigit ore,<br>tum Bitiae dedit increpitans; ille impiger hausit<br>spumantem pateram, et pleno se proluit auro<br>post alii proceres.
