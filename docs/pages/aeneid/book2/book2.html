What Myrmidon or Dolopian, or soldier of stern Ulysses, could in such a tale restrain his tears! and now night falls dewy from the steep of heaven, and the setting stars counsel to slumber. Yet if thy desire be such to know our calamities, and briefly to hear Troy's last agony, though my spirit shudders at the remembrance and recoils in pain, I will essay. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Infandum, regina, iubes renouare dolorem,<br>Troianas ut opes et lamentabile regnum<br>eruerint Danai, quaeque ipse miserrima uidi<br>et quorum pars magna fui. quis talia fando<br>Myrmidonum Dolopumue aut duri miles Vlixi<br>temperet a lacrimis? et iam nox umida caelo<br>praecipitat suadentque cadentia sidera somnos.<br>sed si tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros<br>et breuiter Troiae supremum audire laborem,<br>quamquam animus meminisse horret luctuque refugit,<br>incipiam.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Broken in war and beaten back by fate, and so many years now slid away, the Grecian captains build by Pallas' divine craft a horse of mountainous build, ribbed with sawn fir; they feign it vowed for their return, and this rumour goes about. Within the blind sides they stealthily imprison chosen men picked out one by one, and fill the vast cavern of its womb full with armed soldiery. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">fracti bello fatisque repulsi<br>ductores Danaum tot iam labentibus annis<br>instar montis equum diuina Palladis arte<br>aedificant, sectaque intexunt abiete costas;<br>uotum pro reditu simulant; ea fama uagatur.<br>huc delecta uirum sortiti corpora furtim<br>includunt caeco lateri penitusque cauernas<br>ingentis uterumque armato milite complent.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"There lies in sight an island well known in fame, Tenedos, rich of store while the realm of Priam endured, now but a bay and roadstead treacherous to ships. Hither they launch forth, and hide on the solitary shore: we fancied they were gone, and had run down the wind for Mycenae. So all the Teucrian land put her long grief away. The gates are flung open; men go rejoicingly to see the Doric camp, the deserted stations and abandoned shore. Here the Dolopian troops were tented, here cruel Achilles; here their squadrons lay; here the lines were wont to meet in battle. Some gaze astonished at the deadly gift of Minerva the Virgin, and wonder at the horse's bulk; and Thymoetes begins to advise that it be drawn within our walls and set in the citadel, whether in guile, or that the doom of Troy was even now setting thus. But Capys and they whose mind was of better counsel, bid us either hurl sheer into the sea the guileful and sinister gift of Greece, or heap flames beneath to consume it, or pierce and explore the hollow hiding-place of its womb. The wavering crowd is torn apart in high dispute. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">est in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama<br>insula, diues opum Priami dum regna manebant,<br>nunc tantum sinus et statio male fida carinis:<br>huc se prouecti deserto in litore condunt;<br>nos abiisse rati et uento petiisse Mycenas.<br>ergo omnis longo soluit se Teucria luctu;<br>panduntur portae, iuuat ire et Dorica castra<br>desertosque uidere locos litusque relictum:<br>hic Dolopum manus, hic saeuus tendebat Achilles;<br>classibus hic locus, hic acie certare solebant.<br>pars stupet innuptae donum exitiale Mineruae<br>et molem mirantur equi; primusque Thymoetes<br>duci intra muros hortatur et arce locari,<br>siue dolo seu iam Troiae sic fata ferebant.<br>at Capys, et quorum melior sententia menti,<br>aut pelago Danaum insidias suspectaque dona<br>praecipitare iubent subiectisque urere flammis,<br>aut terebrare cauas uteri et temptare latebras.<br>scinditur incertum studia in contraria uulgus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"At that, foremost of all and with a great throng about him, Laocoön runs hotly down from the high citadel, and cries from far: "Ah, wretched citizens, what height of madness is this? Believe you the foe is gone? or think you any Grecian gift is free of treachery? is it thus we know Ulysses? Either Achaeans are hid in this cage of wood, or the engine is fashioned against our walls to overlook the houses and descend upon the city; some delusion lurks there: trust not the horse, O Trojans. Be it what it may, I fear the Grecians even when they offer gifts." Thus speaking, he hurled his mighty spear with great strength at the creature's side and the curved framework of the belly: the spear stood quivering, and the jarred cavern of the womb sounded hollow and uttered a groan. And had divine ordinance, had a soul not infatuate been with us, he had moved us to lay violent steel on the Argolic hiding place; and Troy would now stand, and you, tall towers of Priam, yet abide. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Primus ibi ante omnis magna comitante caterua<br>Laocoon ardens summa decurrit ab arce,<br>et procul "o miseri, quae tanta insania, ciues?<br>creditis auectos hostis? aut ulla putatis<br>dona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Vlixes?<br>aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achiui,<br>aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros,<br>inspectura domos uenturaque desuper urbi,<br>aut aliquis latet error; equo ne credite, Teucri.<br>quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis."<br>sic fatus ualidis ingentem uiribus hastam<br>in latus inque feri curuam compagibus aluum<br>contorsit. stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso<br>insonuere cauae gemitumque dedere cauernae.<br>et, si fata deum, si mens non laeua fuisset,<br>impulerat ferro Argolicas foedare latebras,<br>Troiaque nunc staret, Priamique arx alta maneres.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Lo, Dardanian shepherds meanwhile dragged clamorously before the King a man with hands tied behind his back, who to compass this very thing, to lay Troy open to the Achaeans, had gone to meet their ignorant approach, confident in spirit and doubly prepared to spin his snares or to meet assured death. From all sides, in eagerness to see, the people of Troy run streaming in, and vie in jeers at their prisoner. Know now the treachery of the Grecians, and from a single crime learn all… For as he stood amid our gaze confounded, disarmed, and cast his eyes around the Phrygian columns, "Alas!" he cried, "what land now, what seas may receive me? or what is the last doom that yet awaits my misery? who have neither any place among the Grecians, and likewise the Dardanians clamour in wrath for the forfeit of my blood." At that lament our spirit was changed, and all assault stayed: we encourage him to speak, and tell of what blood he is sprung, or what assurance he brings his captors. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ecce, manus iuuenem interea post terga reuinctum<br>pastores magno ad regem clamore trahebant<br>Dardanidae, qui se ignotum uenientibus ultro,<br>hoc ipsum ut strueret Troiamque aperiret Achiuis,<br>obtulerat, fidens animi atque in utrumque paratus,<br>seu uersare dolos seu certae occumbere morti.<br>undique uisendi studio Troiana iuuentus<br>circumfusa ruit certantque inludere capto.<br>accipe nunc Danaum insidias et crimine ab uno<br>disce omnis.<br>namque ut conspectu in medio turbatus, inermis<br>constitit atque oculis Phrygia agmina circumspexit,<br>"heu, quae nunc tellus," inquit, "quae me aequora possunt<br>accipere? aut quid iam misero mihi denique restat,<br>cui neque apud Danaos usquam locus, et super ipsi<br>Dardanidae infensi poenas cum sanguine poscunt?"<br>quo gemitu conuersi animi compressus et omnis<br>impetus. hortamur fari quo sanguine cretus,<br>quidue ferat; memoret quae sit fiducia capto.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"'In all things assuredly,' says he, 'O King, befall what may, I will confess to thee the truth; nor will I deny myself of Argolic birth—this first—nor, if Fortune hath made Sinon unhappy, shall her malice mould him to a cheat and a liar. Hath a tale of the name of Palamedes, son of Belus, haply reached thine ears, and of his glorious rumour and renown; whom under false evidence the Pelasgians, because he forbade the war, sent innocent to death by wicked witness; now they bewail him when he hath left the light;—in his company, being near of blood, my father, poor as he was, sent me hither to arms from mine earliest years. While he stood unshaken in royalty and potent in the councils of the kings, we too wore a name and honour. When by subtle Ulysses' malice (no unknown tale do I tell) he left the upper regions, my shattered life crept on in darkness and grief, inly indignant at the fate of my innocent friend. Nor in my madness was I silent: and, should any chance offer, did I ever return a conqueror to my native Argos, I vowed myself his avenger, and with my words I stirred his bitter hatred. From this came the first taint of ill; from this did Ulysses ever threaten me with fresh charges, from this flung dark sayings among the crowd and sought confederate arms. Nay, nor did he rest, till by Calchas' service—but yet why do I vainly unroll the unavailing tale, or why hold you in delay, if all Achaeans are ranked together in your mind, and it is enough that I bear the name? Take the vengeance deferred; this the Ithacan would desire, and the sons of Atreus buy at a great ransom.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Cuncta equidem tibi, rex, fuerit quodcumque, fatebor<br>uera," inquit; "neque me Argolica de gente negabo.<br>hoc primum; nec, si miserum Fortuna Sinonem<br>finxit, uanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.<br>fando aliquod si forte tuas peruenit ad auris<br>Belidae nomen Palamedis et incluta fama<br>gloria, quem falsa sub proditione Pelasgi<br>insontem infando indicio, quia bella uetabat,<br>demisere neci, nunc cassum lumine lugent:<br>illi me comitem et consanguinitate propinquum<br>pauper in arma pater primis huc misit ab annis.<br>dum stabat regno incolumis regumque uigebat<br>conciliis, et nos aliquod nomenque decusque<br>gessimus. inuidia postquam pellacis Vlixi<br>(haud ignota loquor) superis concessit ab oris,<br>adflictus uitam in tenebris luctuque trahebam<br>et casum insontis mecum indignabar amici.<br>nec tacui demens et me, fors si qua tulisset,<br>si patrios umquam remeassem uictor ad Argos,<br>promisi ultorem et uerbis odia aspera moui.<br>hinc mihi prima mali labes, hinc semper Vlixes<br>criminibus terrere nouis, hinc spargere uoces<br>in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma.<br>nec requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministro—<br>sed quid ego haec autem nequiquam ingrata reuoluo,<br>quidue moror? si omnis uno ordine habetis Achiuos,<br>idque audire sat est, iamdudum sumite poenas:<br>hoc Ithacus uelit et magno mercentur Atridae."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Then indeed we press on to ask and inquire the cause, witless of wickedness so great and Pelasgian craft. Tremblingly the false-hearted one pursues his speech: <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tum uero ardemus scitari et quaerere causas,<br>ignari scelerum tantorum artisque Pelasgae.<br>prosequitur pauitans et ficto pectore fatur:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"'Often would the Grecians have taken to flight, leaving Troy behind, and disbanded in weariness of the long war: and would God they had! as often the fierce sea-tempest barred their way, and the gale frightened them from going. Most of all when this horse already stood framed with beams of maple, storm clouds roared over all the sky. In perplexity we send Eurypylus to inquire of Phoebus' oracle; and he brings back from the sanctuary these words of terror: <i>With blood of a slain maiden, O Grecians, you appeased the winds when first you came to the Ilian coasts; with blood must you seek your return, and an Argive life be the accepted sacrifice.</i> When that utterance reached the ears of the crowd, their hearts stood still, and a cold shudder ran through their inmost sense: for whom is doom purposed? who is claimed of Apollo? At this the Ithacan with loud clamour drags Calchas the soothsayer forth amidst them, and demands of him what is this the gods signify. And now many an one foretold me the villain's craft and cruelty, and silently saw what was to come. Twice five days he is speechless in his tent, and will not have any one denounced by his lips, or given up to death. Scarcely at last, at the loud urgence of the Ithacan, he breaks into speech as was planned, and appoints me for the altar. All consented; and each one's particular fear was turned, ah me! to my single destruction. And now the dreadful day was at hand; the rites were being ordered for me, the salted corn, and the chaplets to wreathe my temples. I broke away, I confess it, from death; I burst my bonds, and lurked all night darkling in the sedge of the marshy pool, till they might set their sails, if haply they should set them. Nor have I any hope more of seeing my old home nor my sweet children and the father whom I desire. Of them will they even haply claim vengeance for my flight, and wash away this crime in their wretched death. By the heavenly powers I beseech thee, the deities to whom truth is known, by all the faith yet unsullied that is anywhere left among mortals; pity woes so great; pity an undeserving sufferer.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">"Saepe fugam Danai Troia cupiere relicta<br>moliri et longo fessi discedere bello;<br>fecissentque utinam! saepe illos aspera ponti<br>interclusit hiems et terruit Auster euntis.<br>praecipue cum iam hic trabibus contextus acernis<br>staret equus, toto sonuerunt aethere nimbi.<br>suspensi Eurypylum scitatum oracula Phoebi<br>mittimus, isque adytis haec tristia dicta reportat:<br>'sanguine placastis uentos et uirgine caesa,<br>cum primum Iliacas, Danai, uenistis ad oras;<br>sanguine quaerendi reditus animaque litandum<br>Argolica.' uulgi quae uox ut uenit ad auris,<br>obstipuere animi gelidusque per ima cucurrit<br>ossa tremor, cui fata parent, quem poscat Apollo.<br>hic Ithacus uatem magno Calchanta tumultu<br>protrahit in medios; quae sint ea numina diuum<br>flagitat. et mihi iam multi crudele canebant<br>artificis scelus, et taciti uentura uidebant.<br>bis quinos silet ille dies tectusque recusat<br>prodere uoce sua quemquam aut opponere morti.<br>uix tandem, magnis Ithaci clamoribus actus,<br>composito rumpit uocem et me destinat arae.<br>adsensere omnes et, quae sibi quisque timebat,<br>unius in miseri exitium conuersa tulere.<br>iamque dies infanda aderat; mihi sacra parari<br>et salsae fruges et circum tempora uittae.<br>eripui, fateor, leto me et uincula rupi,<br>limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulua<br>delitui dum uela darent, si forte dedissent.<br>nec mihi iam patriam antiquam spes ulla uidendi<br>nec dulcis natos exoptatumque parentem,<br>quos illi fors et poenas ob nostra reposcent<br>effugia, et culpam hanc miserorum morte piabunt.<br>quod te per superos et conscia numina ueri,<br>per si qua est quae restet adhuc mortalibus usquam<br>intemerata fides, oro, miserere laborum<br>tantorum, miserere animi non digna ferentis."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"At these his tears we grant him life, and accord our pity. Priam himself at once commands his shackles and strait bonds to be undone, and thus speaks with kindly words: 'Whoso thou art, now and henceforth dismiss and forget the Greeks: thou shalt be ours. And unfold the truth to this my question: wherefore have they reared this vast size of horse? who is their counsellor? or what their aim? what propitiation, or what engine of war is this?' He ended; the other, stored with the treacherous craft of Pelasgia, lifts to heaven his freed hands. 'You, everlasting fires,' he cries, 'and your inviolable sanctity be my witness; you, O altars and accursed swords I fled, and chaplets of the gods I wore as victim! unblamed may I break the oath of Greek allegiance, unblamed hate them and bring all to light that they conceal; nor am I bound by any laws of country.

But since the wicked son of Tydeus, and Ulysses, forger of crime, made bold to tear the fated Palladium from her sanctuary, and cut down the sentries on the towered height; since they grasped the holy image, and dared with bloody hands to touch the maiden chaplets of the goddess; since then the hope of Greece ebbed and slid away backwards, their strength was broken, and the mind of the goddess estranged. Whereof the Tritonian gave token by no uncertain signs. Scarcely was the image set in the camp; flame shot sparkling from its lifted eyes, and salt sweat started over its body; thrice, wonderful to tell, it leapt from the ground with shield and spear quivering. Immediately Calchas prophesies that the seas must be explored in flight, nor may Troy towers be overthrown by Argive weapons, except they repeat their auspices at Argos, and bring back that divine presence they have borne away with them in the curved ships overseas. And now they have run down the wind for their native Mycenae, to gather arms and gods to attend them; they will remeasure ocean and be on you unawares. So Calchas expounds the omens. This image at his warning they reared in recompense for the Palladium and the injured deity, to expiate the horror of sacrilege. Yet Calchas bade them raise it to this vast size with oaken crossbeams, and build it up to heaven, that it may not find entry at the gates nor be drawn within the city, nor protect your people beneath the consecration of old. For if hand of yours should violate Minerva's offering, then utter destruction (the gods turn rather on himself his augury!) should be upon Priam's empire and the Phrygian people. But if under your hands it climbed into your city, Asia should advance in mighty war to the walls of Pelops, and a like fate awaited our children's children.' <rtc lang="la" translate="no">omnis spes Danaum et coepti fiducia belli<br>Palladis auxiliis semper stetit. impius ex quo<br>Tydides sed enim scelerumque inuentor Vlixes,<br>fatale adgressi sacrato auellere templo<br>Palladium caesis summae custodibus arcis,<br>corripuere sacram effigiem manibusque cruentis<br>uirgineas ausi diuae contingere uittas,<br>ex illo fluere ac retro sublapsa referri<br>spes Danaum, fractae uires, auersa deae mens.<br>nec dubiis ea signa dedit Tritonia monstris.<br>uix positum castris simulacrum: arsere coruscae<br>luminibus flammae arrectis, salsusque per artus<br>sudor iit, terque ipsa solo (mirabile dictu)<br>emicuit parmamque ferens hastamque trementem.<br>extemplo temptanda fuga canit aequora Calchas,<br>nec posse Argolicis exscindi Pergama telis<br>omina ni repetant Argis numenque reducant<br>quod pelago et curuis secum auexere carinis.<br>et nunc quod patrias uento petiere Mycenas,<br>arma deosque parant comites pelagoque remenso<br>improuisi aderunt; ita digerit omina Calchas.<br>hanc pro Palladio moniti, pro numine laeso<br>effigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.<br>hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem<br>roboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,<br>ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset,<br>neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri.<br>nam si uestra manus uiolasset dona Mineruae,<br>tum magnum exitium (quod di prius omen in ipsum<br>conuertant!)

Laocoön, allotted priest of Neptune, was slaying a great bull at the accustomed altars. And lo! from Tenedos, over the placid depths (I shudder as I recall) two snakes in enormous coils press down the sea and advance together to the shore; their breasts rise through the surge, and their blood-red crests overtop the waves; the rest trails through the main behind and wreathes back in voluminous curves; the brine gurgles and foams. And now they gained the fields, while their bloodshot eyes blazed with fire, and their tongues lapped and flickered in their hissing mouths. We scatter, pallid at the sight. They in unfaltering train make towards Laocoön. And first the serpents twine in their double embrace his two little children, and bite deep in their wretched limbs; then him likewise, as he comes up to help with arms in his hand, they seize and fasten in their enormous coils; and now twice clasping his waist, twice encircling his neck with their scaly bodies, they tower head and neck above him. He at once strains his hands to tear their knots apart, his fillets spattered with foul black venom; at once raises to heaven awful cries; as when, bellowing, a bull shakes the wavering axe from his neck and runs wounded from the altar. But the two snakes glide away to the high sanctuary and seek the fierce Tritonian's citadel, and take shelter under the goddess' feet beneath the circle of her shield. Then indeed a strange terror thrills in all our amazed breasts; and Laocoön, men say, hath fulfilled his crime's desert, in piercing the consecrated wood and hurling his guilty spear into its body. All cry out that the image must be drawn to its home and supplication made to her deity… We sunder the walls, and lay open the inner city. All set to the work; they fix rolling wheels under its feet, and tie hempen bands on its neck. The fated engine climbs our walls, big with arms. Around it boys and unwedded girls chant hymns and joyfully lay their hand on the rope. It moves up, and glides menacing into the middle of the town. O native land! O Ilium, house of gods, and Dardanian city renowned in war! four times in the very gateway did it come to a stand, and four times armour rang in its womb. Yet we urge it on, mindless and infatuate, and plant the ill-ominous thing in our hallowed citadel.

In slumber, lo! before mine eyes Hector seemed to stand by, deep in grief and shedding abundant tears; torn by the chariot, as once of old, and black with gory dust, his swoln feet pierced with the thongs. Ah me! in what guise was he! how changed from the Hector who returns from putting on Achilles' spoils, or launching the fires of Phrygia on the Grecian ships! with ragged beard and tresses clotted with blood, and all the many wounds upon him that he received around his ancestral walls. Myself too weeping I seemed to accost him ere he spoke, and utter forth mournful accents: 'O light of Dardania, O surest hope of the Trojans, what long delay is this hath held thee? from what borders comest thou, Hector our desire? with what weary eyes we see thee, after many deaths of thy kin, after divers woes of people and city! What indignity hath marred thy serene visage? or why discern I these wounds?' He replies naught, nor regards my idle questioning; but heavily drawing a heart-deep groan, 'Ah, fly, goddess-born,' he says, 'and rescue thyself from these flames. The foe holds our walls; from her high ridges Troy is toppling down. Thy country and Priam ask no more. If Troy towers might be defended by strength of hand, this hand too had been their defence. Troy commends to thee her holy things and household gods; take them to accompany thy fate; seek for them a city, which, after all the seas have known thy wanderings, thou shalt at last establish in might.' So speaks he, and carries forth in his hands from their inner shrine the chaplets and strength of Vesta, and the everlasting fire. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Tempus erat quo prima quies mortalibus aegris<br>incipit et dono diuum gratissima serpit.<br>in somnis, ecce, ante oculos maestissimus Hector<br>uisus adesse mihi largosque effundere fletus,<br>raptatus bigis ut quondam, aterque cruento<br>puluere perque pedes traiectus lora tumentis.<br>ei mihi, qualis erat, quantum mutatus ab illo<br>Hectore qui redit exuuias indutus Achilli<br>uel Danaum Phrygios iaculatus puppibus ignis!<br>squalentem barbam et concretos sanguine crinis<br>uulneraque illa gerens, quae circum plurima muros<br>accepit patrios. ultro flens ipse uidebar<br>compellare uirum et maestas expromere uoces:<br>"o lux Dardaniae, spes o fidissima Teucrum,<br>quae tantae tenuere morae? quibus Hector ab oris<br>exspectate uenis? ut te post multa tuorum<br>funera, post uarios hominumque urbisque labores<br>defessi aspicimus! quae causa indigna serenos<br>foedauit uultus? aut cur haec uulnera cerno?"<br>ille nihil, nec me quaerentem uana moratur,<br>sed grauiter gemitus imo de pectore ducens,<br>"heu fuge, nate dea, teque his" ait "eripe flammis.<br>hostis habet muros; ruit alto a culmine Troia.<br>sat patriae Priamoque datum: si Pergama dextra<br>defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent.<br>sacra suosque tibi commendat Troia penatis;<br>hos cape fatorum comites, his moenia quaere<br>magna pererrato statues quae denique ponto."<br>sic ait et manibus uittas Vestamque potentem<br>aeternumque adytis effert penetralibus ignem.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Meanwhile the city is stirred with mingled agony; and more and more, though my father Anchises' house lay deep withdrawn and screened by trees, the noises grow clearer and the clash of armour swells. I shake myself from sleep and mount over the sloping roof, and stand there with ears attent: even as when flame catches a corn-field while south winds are furious, or the racing torrent of a mountain stream sweeps the fields, sweeps the smiling crops and labours of the oxen, and hurls the forest with it headlong; the shepherd in witless amaze hears the roar from the cliff-top. Then indeed proof is clear, and the treachery of the Grecians opens out. Already the house of Deïphobus hath crashed down in wide ruin amid the overpowering flames; already our neighbour Ucalegon is ablaze: the broad Sigean bay is lit with the fire. Cries of men and blare of trumpets rise up. Madly I seize my arms, nor is there so much purpose in arms; but my spirit is on fire to gather a band for fighting and charge for the citadel with my comrades.

"How stands the state, O Panthus? what stronghold are we to occupy?" Scarcely had I said so, when groaning he thus returns: "The crowning day is come, the irreversible time of the Dardanian land. No more are we a Trojan people; Ilium and the great glory of the Teucrians is no more. Angry Jupiter hath cast all into the scale of Argos. The Grecians are lords of the burning town. The horse, standing high amid the city, pours forth armed men, and Sinon scatters fire, insolent in victory. Some are at the wide-flung gates, all the thousands that ever came from populous Mycenae. Others have beset the narrow streets with lowered weapons; edge and glittering point of steel stand drawn, ready for the slaughter; scarcely at the entry do the guards of the gates essay battle, and hold out in the blind fight." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ecce autem telis Panthus elapsus Achiuum,<br>Panthus Othryades, arcis Phoebique sacerdos,<br>sacra manu uictosque deos paruumque nepotem<br>ipse trahit cursuque amens ad limina tendit.<br>"quo res summa loco, Panthu? quam prendimus arcem?"<br>uix ea fatus eram gemitu cum talia reddit:<br>"uenit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus<br>Dardaniae. fuimus Troes, fuit Ilium et ingens<br>gloria Teucrorum; ferus omnia Iuppiter Argos<br>transtulit; incensa Danai dominantur in urbe.<br>arduus armatos mediis in moenibus astans<br>fundit equus uictorque Sinon incendia miscet<br>insultans. portis alii bipatentibus adsunt,<br>milia quot magnis umquam uenere Mycenis;<br>obsedere alii telis angusta uiarum<br>oppositis; stat ferri acies mucrone corusco<br>stricta, parata neci; uix primi proelia temptant<br>portarum uigiles et caeco Marte resistunt."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Heaven's will thus declared by the son of Othrys drives me amid flames and arms, where the baleful Fury calls, and tumult of shouting rises up.

In those days it was he had come to Troy, fired with mad passion for Cassandra, and bore a son's aid to Priam and the Phrygians: hapless, that he listened not to his raving bride's counsels… Seeing them close-ranked and daring for battle, I therewith began thus: "Men, hearts of supreme and useless bravery, if your desire be fixed to follow one who dares the utmost; you see what is the fortune of our state: all the gods by whom this empire was upheld have gone forth, abandoning shrine and altar; your aid comes to a burning city.

Then, like wolves ravening in a black fog, whom mad malice of hunger hath driven blindly forth, and their cubs left behind await with throats unslaked; through the weapons of the enemy we march to certain death, and hold our way straight into the town. Night's sheltering shadow flutters dark around us. Who may unfold in speech that night's horror and death-agony, or measure its woes in weeping? The ancient city falls with her long years of sovereignty; corpses lie stretched stiff all about the streets and houses and awful courts of the gods. Nor do Teucrians alone pay forfeit of their blood; once and again valour returns even in conquered hearts, and the victorious Grecians fall. Everywhere is cruel agony, everywhere terror, and the sight of death at every turn. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">sic animis iuuenum furor additus. inde, lupi ceu<br>raptores atra in nebula, quos improba uentris<br>exegit caecos rabies catulique relicti<br>faucibus exspectant siccis, per tela, per hostis<br>uadimus haud dubiam in mortem mediaeque tenemus<br>urbis iter; nox atra caua circumuolat umbra.<br>quis cladem illius noctis, quis funera fando<br>explicet aut possit lacrimis aequare labores?<br>urbs antiqua ruit multos dominata per annos;<br>plurima perque uias sternuntur inertia passim<br>corpora perque domos et religiosa deorum<br>limina. nec soli poenas dant sanguine Teucri;<br>quondam etiam uictis redit in praecordia uirtus<br>uictoresque cadunt Danai. crudelis ubique<br>luctus, ubique pauor et plurima mortis imago.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"First, with a great troop of Grecians attending him, Androgeus meets us, taking us in ignorance for an allied band, and opens on us with friendly words: "Hasten, my men; why idly linger so late? others plunder and harry the burning citadel; are you but now on your march from the tall ships?" He spoke, and immediately (for no answer of any assurance was offered) knew he was fallen among the foe. In amazement, he checked foot and voice; even as one who struggling through rough briers hath trodden a snake on the ground unwarned, and suddenly shrinks fluttering back as it rises in anger and puffs its green throat out; even thus Androgeus drew away, startled at the sight. We rush in and encircle them with serried arms, and cut them down dispersedly in their ignorance of the ground and seizure of panic. Fortune speeds our first labour. And here Coroebus, flushed with success and spirit, cries: "O comrades, follow me where fortune points before us the path of safety, and shews her favour. Let us exchange shields, and accoutre ourselves in Grecian suits; whether craft or courage, who will ask of an enemy? the foe shall arm our hands." Thus speaking, he next dons the plumed helmet and beautifully blazoned shield of Androgeus, and fits the Argive sword to his side. So does Rhipeus, so Dymas in like wise, and all our men in delight arm themselves one by one in the fresh spoils. We advance, mingling with the Grecians, under a protection not our own, and join many a battle with those we meet amid the blind night; many a Greek we send down to hell. Some scatter to the ships and run for the safety of the shore; some in craven fear again climb the huge horse, and hide in the belly they knew. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Primus se Danaum magna comitante caterua<br>Androgeos offert nobis, socia agmina credens<br>inscius, atque ultro uerbis compellat amicis:<br>"festinate, uiri! nam quae tam sera moratur<br>segnities? alii rapiunt incensa feruntque<br>Pergama: uos celsis nunc primum a nauibus itis?"<br>dixit, et extemplo (neque enim responsa dabantur<br>fida satis) sensit medios delapsus in hostis.<br>obstipuit retroque pedem cum uoce repressit.<br>improuisum aspris ueluti qui sentibus anguem<br>pressit humi nitens trepidusque repente refugit<br>attollentem iras et caerula colla tumentem,<br>haud secus Androgeos uisu tremefactus abibat.<br>inruimus densis et circumfundimur armis,<br>ignarosque loci passim et formidine captos<br>sternimus; aspirat primo Fortuna labori.<br>atque hic successu exsultans animisque Coroebus<br>"o socii, qua prima" inquit "Fortuna salutis<br>monstrat iter, quaque ostendit se dextra, sequamur:<br>mutemus clipeos Danaumque insignia nobis<br>aptemus. dolus an uirtus, quis in hoste requirat?<br>arma dabunt ipsi." sic fatus deinde comantem<br>Androgei galeam clipeique insigne decorum<br>induitur laterique Argiuum accommodat ensem.<br>hoc Rhipeus, hoc ipse Dymas omnisque iuuentus<br>laeta facit: spoliis se quisque recentibus armat.<br>uadimus immixti Danais haud numine nostro<br>multaque per caecam congressi proelia noctem<br>conserimus, multos Danaum demittimus Orco.<br>diffugiunt alii ad nauis et litora cursu<br>fida petunt; pars ingentem formidine turpi<br>scandunt rursus equum et nota conduntur in aluo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Alas that none may trust at all to estranged gods! <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Heu nihil inuitis fas quemquam fidere diuis!</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Lo! Cassandra, maiden daughter of Priam, was being dragged with disordered tresses from the temple and sanctuary of Minerva, straining to heaven her blazing eyes in vain; her eyes, for fetters locked her delicate hands. At this sight Coroebus burst forth infuriate, and flung himself on death amid their columns. We all follow him up, and charge with massed arms. Here first from the high temple roof we are overwhelmed with our own people's weapons, and a most pitiful slaughter begins through the fashion of our armour and the mistaken Greek crests; then the Grecians, with angry cries at the maiden's rescue, gather from every side and fall on us; Ajax in all his valour, and the two sons of Atreus, and the whole Dolopian army: as oft when bursting in whirlwind West and South clash with adverse blasts, and the East wind exultant on the coursers of the Dawn; the forests cry, and fierce in foam Nereus with his trident stirs the seas from their lowest depth. Those too appear, whom our stratagem routed through the darkness of dim night and drove all about the town; at once they know the shields and lying weapons, and mark the alien tone on our lips. We go down, overwhelmed by numbers. First Coroebus is stretched by Peneleus' hand at the altar of the goddess armipotent; and Rhipeus falls, the one man who was most righteous and steadfast in justice among the Teucrians: the gods' ways are not as ours: Hypanis and Dymas perish, pierced by friendly hands; nor did all thy goodness, O Panthus, nor Apollo's fillet protect thy fall. O ashes of Ilium and death flames of my people! you I call to witness that in your ruin I shunned no Grecian weapon or encounter, and my hand earned my fall, had destiny been thus. We tear ourselves away, I and Iphitus and Pelias, Iphitus now stricken in age, Pelias halting too under the wound of Ulysses, called forward by the clamour to Priam's house. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">ecce trahebatur passis Priameia uirgo<br>crinibus a templo Cassandra adytisque Mineruae<br>ad caelum tendens ardentia lumina frustra,<br>lumina, nam teneras arcebant uincula palmas.<br>non tulit hanc speciem furiata mente Coroebus<br>et sese medium iniecit periturus in agmen;<br>consequimur cuncti et densis incurrimus armis.<br>hic primum ex alto delubri culmine telis<br>nostrorum obruimur oriturque miserrima caedes<br>armorum facie et Graiarum errore iubarum.<br>tum Danai gemitu atque ereptae uirginis ira<br>undique collecti inuadunt, acerrimus Aiax<br>et gemini Atridae Dolopumque exercitus omnis:<br>aduersi rupto ceu quondam turbine uenti<br>confligunt, Zephyrusque Notusque et laetus Eois<br>Eurus equis; stridunt siluae saeuitque tridenti<br>spumeus atque imo Nereus ciet aequora fundo.<br>illi etiam, si quos obscura nocte per umbram<br>fudimus insidiis totaque agitauimus urbe,<br>apparent; primi clipeos mentitaque tela<br>agnoscunt atque ora sono discordia signant.<br>ilicet obruimur numero, primusque Coroebus<br>Penelei dextra diuae armipotentis ad aram<br>procumbit; cadit et Rhipeus, iustissimus unus<br>qui fuit in Teucris et seruantissimus aequi<br>(dis aliter uisum); pereunt Hypanisque Dymasque<br>confixi a sociis; nec te tua plurima, Panthu,<br>labentem pietas nec Apollinis infula texit.<br>Iliaci cineres et flamma extrema meorum,<br>testor, in occasu uestro nec tela nec ullas<br>uitauisse uices, Danaum et, si fata fuissent<br>ut caderem, meruisse manu. diuellimur inde,<br>Iphitus et Pelias mecum (quorum Iphitus aeuo<br>iam grauior, Pelias et uulnere tardus Vlixi),<br>protinus ad sedes Priami clamore uocati.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Here indeed the battle is fiercest, as if all the rest of the fighting were nowhere, and no slaughter but here throughout the city, so do we descry the war in full fury, the Grecians rushing on the building, and their shielded column driving up against the beleaguered threshold. Ladders cling to the walls; and hard by the doors and planted on the rungs they hold up their shields in the left hand to ward off our weapons, and with their right clutch the battlements. The Dardanians tear down turrets and the covering of the house roof against them; with these for weapons, since they see the end is come, they prepare to defend themselves even in death's extremity: and hurl down gilded beams, the stately decorations of their fathers of old. Others with drawn swords have beset the doorway below and keep it in crowded column. We renew our courage, to aid the royal dwelling, to support them with our succour, and swell the force of the conquered. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">hic uero ingentem pugnam, ceu cetera nusquam<br>bella forent, nulli tota morerentur in urbe,<br>sic Martem indomitum Danaosque ad tecta ruentis<br>cernimus obsessumque acta testudine limen.<br>haerent parietibus scalae postisque sub ipsos<br>nituntur gradibus clipeosque ad tela sinistris<br>protecti obiciunt, prensant fastigia dextris.<br>Dardanidae contra turris ac tota domorum<br>culmina conuellunt; his se, quando ultima cernunt,<br>extrema iam in morte parant defendere telis,<br>auratasque trabes, ueterum decora alta parentum,<br>deuoluunt; alii strictis mucronibus imas<br>obsedere fores, has seruant agmine denso.<br>instaurati animi regis succurrere tectis<br>auxilioque leuare uiros uimque addere uictis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"There was a blind doorway giving passage through the range of Priam's halls by a solitary postern, whereby, while our realm endured, hapless Andromache would often and often glide unattended to her father-in-law's house, and carry the boy Astyanax to his grandsire. I issue out on the sloping height of the ridge, whence wretched Teucrian hands were hurling their ineffectual weapons. A tower stood on the sheer brink, its roof ascending high into heaven, whence was wont to be seen all Troy and the Grecian ships and Achaean camp: attacking it with iron round about, where the joints of the lofty flooring yielded, we wrench it from its deep foundations and shake it free; it gives way, and suddenly falls thundering in ruin, crashing wide over the Grecian ranks. But others swarm up; nor meanwhile do stones nor any sort of missile slacken… Right before the vestibule and in the front doorway Pyrrhus moves rejoicingly in the sparkle of arms and gleaming brass: like as when a snake fed on poisonous herbs, whom chill winter kept hid and swollen underground, now fresh from his weeds outworn and shining in youth, wreathes his slippery body into the daylight, his upreared breast meets the sun, and his triple-cloven tongue flickers in his mouth. With him huge Periphas, and Automedon the armour-bearer, driver of Achilles' horses, with him all his Scyrian men climb the roof and hurl flames on the housetop. Himself among the foremost he grasps a poleaxe, bursts through the hard doorway, and wrenches the brazen-plated doors from the hinge; and now he hath cut out a plank from the solid oak and pierced a vast gaping hole. The house within is open to sight, and the long halls lie plain; open to sight are the secret chambers of Priam and the kings of old, and they see armed men standing in front of the doorway. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Limen erat caecaeque fores et peruius usus<br>tectorum inter se Priami, postesque relicti<br>a tergo, infelix qua se, dum regna manebant,<br>saepius Andromache ferre incomitata solebat<br>ad soceros et auo puerum Astyanacta trahebat.<br>euado ad summi fastigia culminis, unde<br>tela manu miseri iactabant inrita Teucri.<br>turrim in praecipiti stantem summisque sub astra<br>eductam tectis, unde omnis Troia uideri<br>et Danaum solitae naues et Achaica castra,<br>adgressi ferro circum, qua summa labantis<br>iuncturas tabulata dabant, conuellimus altis<br>sedibus impulimusque; ea lapsa repente ruinam<br>cum sonitu trahit et Danaum super agmina late<br>incidit. ast alii subeunt, nec saxa nec ullum<br>telorum interea cessat genus.<br>Vestibulum ante ipsum primoque in limine Pyrrhus<br>exsultat telis et luce coruscus aena:<br>qualis ubi in lucem coluber mala gramina pastus,<br>frigida sub terra tumidum quem bruma tegebat,<br>nunc, positis nouus exuuiis nitidusque iuuenta,<br>lubrica conuoluit sublato pectore terga<br>arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis.<br>una ingens Periphas et equorum agitator Achillis,<br>armiger Automedon, una omnis Scyria pubes<br>succedunt tecto et flammas ad culmina iactant.<br>ipse inter primos correpta dura bipenni<br>limina perrumpit postisque a cardine uellit<br>aeratos; iamque excisa trabe firma cauauit<br>robora et ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram.<br>apparet domus intus et atria longa patescunt;<br>apparent Priami et ueterum penetralia regum,<br>armatosque uident stantis in limine primo.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"But the inner house is stirred with shrieks and misery and confusion, and the court echoes deep with women's wailing; the golden stars are smitten with the din. Affrighted mothers stray about the vast house, and cling fast to the doors and print them with kisses. With his father's might Pyrrhus presses on; nor guards nor barriers can hold out. The gate totters under the hard driven ram, and the doors fall flat, rent from the hinge. Force makes way; the Greeks burst through the entrance and pour in, slaughtering the foremost, and filling the space with a wide stream of soldiers. Not so furiously when a foaming river bursts his banks and overflows, beating down the opposing dykes with whirling water, is he borne mounded over the fields, and sweeps herds and pens all about the plains. Myself I saw in the gateway Neoptolemus mad in slaughter, and the two sons of Atreus, saw Hecuba and the hundred daughters of her house, and Priam polluting with his blood the altar fires of his own consecration. The fifty bridal chambers—so great was the hope of his children's children—their doors magnificent with spoils of barbaric gold, have sunk in ruin; where the fire fails the Greeks are in possession. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">at domus interior gemitu miseroque tumultu<br>miscetur, penitusque cauae plangoribus aedes<br>femineis ululant; ferit aurea sidera clamor.<br>tum pauidae tectis matres ingentibus errant<br>amplexaeque tenent postis atque oscula figunt.<br>instat ui patria Pyrrhus; nec claustra nec ipsi<br>custodes sufferre ualent; labat ariete crebro<br>ianua, et emoti procumbunt cardine postes.<br>fit uia ui; rumpunt aditus primosque trucidant<br>immissi Danai et late loca milite complent.<br>non sic, aggeribus ruptis cum spumeus amnis<br>exiit oppositasque euicit gurgite moles,<br>fertur in arua furens cumulo camposque per omnis<br>cum stabulis armenta trahit. uidi ipse furentem<br>caede Neoptolemum geminosque in limine Atridas,<br>uidi Hecubam centumque nurus Priamumque per aras<br>sanguine foedantem quos ipse sacrauerat ignis.<br>quinquaginta illi thalami, spes tanta nepotum,<br>barbarico postes auro spoliisque superbi<br>procubuere; tenent Danai qua deficit ignis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Perchance too thou mayest inquire what was Priam's fate. When he saw the ruin of his captured city, the gates of his house burst open, and the enemy amid his innermost chambers, the old man idly fastens round his aged trembling shoulders his long disused armour, girds on the unavailing sword, and advances on his death among the thronging foe. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Forsitan et Priami fuerint quae fata requiras.<br>urbis uti captae casum conuulsaque uidit<br>limina tectorum et medium in penetralibus hostem,<br>arma diu senior desueta trementibus aeuo<br>circumdat nequiquam umeris et inutile ferrum<br>cingitur, ac densos fertur moriturus in hostis.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Within the palace and under the bare cope of sky was a massive altar, and hard on the altar an ancient bay tree leaned clasping the household gods in its shadow. Here Hecuba and her daughters crowded vainly about the altar-stones, like doves driven headlong by a black tempest, and crouched clasping the gods' images. And when she saw Priam her lord with the armour of youth on him, "What spirit of madness, my poor husband," she cries, "hath stirred thee to gird on these weapons? or whither dost thou run? Not such the succour nor these the defenders the time requires: no, were mine own Hector now beside us. Retire, I beseech thee, hither; this altar will protect us all, or thou wilt share our death." With these words on her lips she drew the aged man to her, and set him on the holy seat. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">aedibus in mediis nudoque sub aetheris axe<br>ingens ara fuit iuxtaque ueterrima laurus<br>incumbens arae atque umbra complexa penatis.<br>hic Hecuba et natae nequiquam altaria circum,<br>praecipites atra ceu tempestate columbae,<br>condensae et diuum amplexae simulacra sedebant.<br>ipsum autem sumptis Priamum iuuenalibus armis<br>ut uidit, "quae mens tam dira, miserrime coniunx,<br>impulit his cingi telis? aut quo ruis?" inquit.<br>"non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis<br>tempus eget; non, si ipse meus nunc adforet Hector.<br>huc tandem concede; haec ara tuebitur omnis,<br>aut moriere simul." sic ore effata recepit<br>ad sese et sacra longaeuum in sede locauit.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"And lo, escaped from slaughtering Pyrrhus through the weapons of the enemy, Polites, one of Priam's children, flies wounded down the long colonnades and circles the empty halls. Pyrrhus pursues him fiercely with aimed wound, just catching at him, and follows hard on him with his spear. As at last he issued before his parents' eyes and faces, he fell, and shed his life in a pool of blood. At this Priam, although even now fast in the toils of death, yet withheld not nor spared a wrathful cry: "Ah, for thy crime, for this thy hardihood, may the gods, if there is goodness in heaven to care for aught such, pay thee in full thy worthy meed, and return thee the reward that is due! who hast made me look face to face on my child's murder, and polluted a father's countenance with death. Ah, not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm." Thus the old man spoke, and launched his weak and unwounding spear, which, recoiling straight from the jarring brass, hung idly from his shield above the boss. Thereat Pyrrhus: "Thou then shalt tell this, and go with the message to my sire the son of Peleus: remember to tell him of my baleful deeds, and the degeneracy of Neoptolemus. Now die." So saying, he drew him quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side. This was the end of Priam's fortunes; thus did allotted fate find him, with burning Troy and her sunken towers before his eyes, once magnificent lord over so many peoples and lands of Asia. The great corpse lies along the shore, a head severed from the shoulders and a body without a name. <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ecce autem elapsus Pyrrhi de caede Polites,<br>unus natorum Priami, per tela, per hostis<br>porticibus longis fugit et uacua atria lustrat<br>saucius. illum ardens infesto uulnere Pyrrhus<br>insequitur, iam iamque manu tenet et premit hasta.<br>ut tandem ante oculos euasit et ora parentum,<br>concidit ac multo uitam cum sanguine fudit.<br>hic Priamus, quamquam in media iam morte tenetur,<br>non tamen abstinuit nec uoci iraeque pepercit:<br>"at tibi pro scelere," exclamat, "pro talibus ausis<br>di, si qua est caelo pietas quae talia curet,<br>persoluant grates dignas et praemia reddant<br>debita, qui nati coram me cernere letum<br>fecisti et patrios foedasti funere uultus.<br>at non ille, satum quo te mentiris, Achilles<br>talis in hoste fuit Priamo; sed iura fidemque<br>supplicis erubuit corpusque exsangue sepulcro<br>reddidit Hectoreum meque in mea regna remisit."<br>sic fatus senior telumque imbelle sine ictu<br>coniecit, rauco quod protinus aere repulsum,<br>et summo clipei nequiquam umbone pependit.<br>cui Pyrrhus: "referes ergo haec et nuntius ibis<br>Pelidae genitori. illi mea tristia facta<br>degeneremque Neoptolemum narrare memento.<br>nunc morere." hoc dicens altaria ad ipsa trementem<br>traxit et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati,<br>implicuitque comam laeua, dextraque coruscum<br>extulit ac lateri capulo tenus abdidit ensem.<br>haec finis Priami fatorum, hic exitus illum<br>sorte tulit Troiam incensam et prolapsa uidentem<br>Pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum<br>regnatorem Asiae. iacet ingens litore truncus,<br>auulsumque umeris caput et sine nomine corpus.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"But then an awful terror began to encircle me; I stood in amaze; there rose before me the likeness of my loved father, as I saw the king, old as he, sobbing out his life under the ghastly wound; there rose Creüsa forlorn, my plundered house, and little Iülus' peril.

My spirit kindles to fire, and rises in wrath to avenge my dying land and take repayment for her crimes. Shall she verily see Sparta and her native Mycenae unscathed, and depart a queen and triumphant? Shall she see her spousal and her home, her parents and children, attended by a crowd of Trojan women and Phrygians to serve her? and Priam have fallen under the sword?

We in a flutter of affright shook out the blazing hair and quenched the holy fires with spring water. But lord Anchises joyfully upraised his eyes; and stretching his hands to heaven: "Jupiter omnipotent," he cries, "if thou dost relent at any prayers, look on us this once alone; and if our goodness deserve it, give thine aid hereafter, O lord, and confirm this thine omen." <rtc lang="la" translate="no">Talia uociferans gemitu tectum omne replebat,<br>cum subitum dictuque oritur mirabile monstrum.<br>namque manus inter maestorumque ora parentum<br>ecce leuis summo de uertice uisus Iuli<br>fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia mollis<br>lambere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.<br>nos pauidi trepidare metu crinemque flagrantem<br>excutere et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignis.<br>at pater Anchises oculos ad sidera laetus<br>extulit et caelo palmas cum uoce tetendit:<br>"Iuppiter omnipotens, precibus si flecteris ullis,<br>aspice nos, hoc tantum, et si pietate meremur,<br>da deinde auxilium, pater, atque haec omina firma."</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"Scarcely had the aged man spoken thus, when with sudden crash it thundered on the left, and a star gliding through the dusk shot from heaven drawing a bright trail of light.

Little Iülus, with his hand fast in mine, keeps uneven pace after his father. Behind my wife follows. We pass on in the shadows.

I espy the gleaming shields and the flicker of brass." At this, in my flurry and confusion, some hostile god bereft me of my senses. For while I plunge down byways, and swerve from where the familiar streets ran, Creüsa, alas! whether, torn by fate from her unhappy husband, she stood still, or did she mistake the way, or sink down outwearied? I know not; and never again was she given back to our eyes; nor did I turn to look for my lost one, or cast back a thought, ere we were come to ancient Ceres' mound and hallowed seat; here at last, when all gathered, one was missing, vanished from her child's and her husband's company. What man or god did I spare in frantic reproaches? or what crueller sight met me in our city's overthrow? I charge my comrades with Ascanius and lord Anchises, and the gods of Teucria, hiding them in the winding vale. Myself I regain the city, girding on my shining armour; fixed to renew every danger, to retrace my way throughout Troy, and fling myself again on its perils. First of all I regain the walls and the dim gateway whence my steps had issued; I scan and follow back my footprints with searching gaze in the night. Everywhere my spirit shudders, dismayed at the very silence. Thence I pass on home, if haply her feet (if haply!) had led her thither. The Grecians had poured in, and filled the palace. The devouring fire goes rolling before the wind high as the roof; the flames tower over it, and the heat surges up into the air. I move on, and revisit the citadel and Priam's dwelling; where now in the spacious porticoes of Juno's sanctuary, Phoenix and accursed Ulysses, chosen sentries, were guarding the spoil. Hither from all quarters is flung in masses the treasure of Troy torn from burning shrines, tables of the gods, bowls of solid gold, and raiment of the captives. Boys and cowering mothers in long file stand round… Yes, and I dared to cry abroad through the darkness; I filled the streets with calling, and again and yet again with vain reiterance cried piteously on Creüsa. As I stormed and sought her endlessly among the houses of the town, there rose before mine eyes a melancholy phantom, the ghost of very Creüsa, in likeness larger than her wont. I was motionless; my hair stood up, and the accents faltered on my tongue. Then she thus addressed me, and with this speech allayed my distresses: "What help is there in this mad passion of grief, sweet my husband? not without divine influence does this come to pass: nor may it be, nor does the high lord of Olympus allow, that thou shouldest carry Creüsa hence in thy company. Long shall be thine exile, and weary spaces of sea must thou furrow through; and thou shalt come to the land Hesperia, where Lydian Tiber flows with soft current through rich and populous fields. There prosperity awaits thee, and a kingdom, and a king's daughter for thy wife. Dispel these tears for thy beloved Creüsa. Never will I look on the proud homes of the Myrmidons or Dolopians, or go to be the slave of Greek matrons, I a daughter of Dardania, a daughter-in-law of Venus the goddess… But the mighty mother of the gods keeps me in these her borders. And now farewell, and still love thy child and mine." This speech uttered, while I wept and would have said many a thing, she left me and retreated into thin air. Thrice there was I fain to lay mine arms round her neck; thrice the vision I vainly clasped fled out of my hands, even as the light breezes, or most like to fluttering sleep.
