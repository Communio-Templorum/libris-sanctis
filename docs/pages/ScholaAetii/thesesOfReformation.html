I have had the most diverse experience both with groups and individuals seeking religion and spirituality. I have learned to give an ear to all sorts of people in their plight, from those who were simply stressed, to the heartbroken and depressed, and I sat at the deathbed of dying, giving them religious comfort. I have accompanied people through most depths of human life, and tried as Priest to be a friend and supporter as best as I can, and I came to regard that as Serving the Gods in the most true sense of RELIGIO: bringing the distressed souls of men back to the Light in times of Darkness, be it an individual darkness or a darkness born of the times we live in.</p><p>Looking at the world as Philosopher, Historian and Social Scientist, it is clear we live now in dark and chaotic times, where our Civilization is in peril as it has not been in a long time. Such times of darkening also add to the suffering of people. What other calling could one following the Gods have, than to do his best as Priest to be a candle in the night: for each person the Priest is fated to meet, is a test for the Priest to proof his quality, his calling, to ease suffering, to give hope and to inspire people to move on. In these more than three decades I learned one thing: we grow by helping others to grow. Since we are all connected, all coming from the Divine Realm into this mundane matter, bringing people the wisdom of the Gods means to be helper and guide, and more so in dark times as these, as in the dark time of each individual.</p><p>It is that care for men, for the people, that has kept me on the path, and myself giving myself to the Gods, has been so fruitful and enriching, allowing me to carry on no matter what befell me, that I always was in the light of the Gods, that I wish to pass this on to the people I meet. It is out of these 31 years of work as Priest, I came to form ideas and many of my ideas you can read in the countless Lessons I wrote in the Schola Aetii.</p><p>The idea that our beloved Roman Religion should not merely be revived, but reviewed and brought up to the task and questions of our time, was what I launched almost two years ago. Since then, many people participated in the debate what direction it might go, what might be reformed, and what should remain as it was. Of course others have taken the view, that Reform itself is not what they seem wise and right, and this debate is going on yet. I had on purpose refrained from adding some stronger guidelines as I saw them, to let the debate go on without me pushing it into a direction too early. But now, partially by the passing of time, partially by hearing the many arguments of all sides, it is time for me to step up and present my own concrete thoughts and suggestions, on this level as I believe is the only right way to move our Religion ahead in a way that it can stand the test of time, and grow out of a niche for only a few, thus making it worthy for the great Gods. As such I shall present you these 18 Tenets of the Reformed Roman Religion, THE THIRD COVENANT, and why it is called as such.</p><h3>Divine Origin</h3><p>All human beings came from the Divine; that is their origin and their home, as it is written by Plato in the words of Socrates in the Book “PHAIDROS”. We take this view as the true origin of humanity, that we came from the company of the Gods, having been divine and immortal in their company. The highest aim of RELIGION is therefore to mend this schism between Gods and Mortals, to acknowledge the individuality of each person, originally coming from the company of a different God, and to enable each mortal soul to find a path to ascend and return to the Divine Home from whence he or she came.</p><h3>The First Covenant</h3><p>While Gods and Men are always in connection, for the Gods love all mortal beings and wish their welfare and their return to the Divine Company, they formed a special bond, which I shall call Covenant, with the Great Fathers, and the one to whom it was given, was King Numa the Seer. He was revealed how to reform the antique practices and to establish change, through Divine Council, and so he became the first Prophet or Founder. Numa ordered the Cultus for the future, and the system he built for the Romans and all who would join then, was a contract between Gods and Men, we call that the FIRST COVENANT. The hallmark of the First Covenant was, that the King and the Senate would act as custodians of the Cult, so it was split in two parts: Sacra Publica and Sacra Privata, the first were all Romans had one Religion, organized by the government, the second so that people could in private do their religious ceremonies as they pleased. This gave a great sense of unity to the people of the time, but it also left the Cult in the hands of politicians, with no great interest in seeing the people spiritually develop, and as time passed, the First Covenant more and more was used to keep up the political status quo of power, which became more and more dramatic around the Galilean timeline, which the Cultus in the hand of politicians had reached it's lowest point, and finally the First Covenant failed, so it had to be restored by Emperor Augustus in the Second Covenant.</p><h3>The Three Fathers</h3><p>Leading up to form the First Covenant we regard three men of particular importance, each chosen by the Gods for a task to make this Covenant possible, and these are Aeneas, Romulus and Numa. We hold these as great ideals and role models: Aeneas for the will to leave something behind that has its time passed. Romulus for the grandeur of taking in every kind of people no matter their background. Numa, for the elevated spirituality seeking direct divine council how to reform religion and establish a New Covenant.</p><h3>Numa the Seer</h3><p>We regard Numa as the first in our religion to actively seek regular divine council, and expressis verbis be guided by divine word and education, as how to reform religion by divine council of a single person, upon whose vision and divine inspiration a new Religious Cult was built on the heritage of the past. It demonstrates, that religion can always be reformed, and when new ways are established in the world, inspired people are used by the Gods as Seer. So it was when Rome was founded, a change in the world transpired, and religion had to be reformed by a chosen Seer, King Numa, to recreate a new form fitting the coming new times. We must learn this lesson from King Numa the Seer, that new times require new forms, fitting the new situation of the world, to courageously seek outthe guidance of the Gods and seek unity behind those whom the Gods inspired, for it was this unity behind Numa and his companions, that allowed Rome to prosper, and it was the falling away from the teachings of Numa, that gradually the Republic would degenerate.</p><h3>The Schism of Priests and Seers</h3><p>The great sin which caused the Fall of the Republic and with it the First Covenant, came to be, because what once was a sacred way to elevate people, in the hands of politicians without spirituality, it became a tool to manipulate politics and to broaden their power. Thus the sacredness of the Cult was profaned and the dismay of the Gods let the Republic sink into chaos, anarchy and the Fall. Numa had given the example to be in close guidance with the Divine directly, just as Socrates the Holy had been listening to his DAIMON, a messenger of the Gods, in all his doings, and was guided so wisely through his life. When the Gods are close to us, we live in prosperity, but when things decay, it is a sign of the Heaven that the leaders lost their Mandate, and thus we must read the waning days of the Republic as a warning sign, to repent and to return to the spiritual ways of Numa and the Elders, but alas the politicians corrupted the Cult and it became stale. They did no longer listen to the Seers and those who heard the whisper of the Gods, but instead gradually removed all individual spirituality from the Public Cult, degrading it to a mere personal quirk without connection to the whole. Simply said, the Priests of the late Republic no longer had any spiritual connection to the Gods, and the Gods punished the Republic with its Fall, so that the Romans would listen and learn from this.</p><h3>The Three Sanctums</h3><p>Every religion has three Sanctums, which are three levels of spirituality, and while not all religions manifest them, a religion in order to be meaningful must have these, and the three Sancti must be in cooperation and productive synergy. They are basically levels of dedication.</p><div>These three are:<ol><li>The Mystery</li><li>The Public Cult</li><li>The Private Cult</li></ol></div><p>The Mystery is the level of the initiated, who are in communication with the Divines, the Gods. They can be called Seers or Augurs, Prophets or Oracles, and each of these diverse forms have their own merits. I shall for the sake of simplicity call them Seers, for a Seer is one who sees what others can not. We know through history that the Gods do not chose all people alike, and give vision and voice only to a few in each generation, and this is the test of character both to the Seer not to abuse this privilege, as well as to those listening to be tested in their piety and wisdom. The other element is that of below, the Private Cult, which preserved the inherited tradition, and is a living, evolving tradition, so the Seers are the element of the Heaven and the Individuals with their Sacra Privata are the element of the Earth, and in communion of these two the Sacra Publica is formed and administered by the Priests, who stand in balance between the Voice of the Gods and the Needs of Mortal Men, and in accordance to this balance form and reform the Sacra Publica, so that it equally serves Gods and Men.</p><h3>The Second Covenant</h3><p>When the Republic fell, it was because the Senate and the aristocratic families had failed to develop the relation to the Gods properly, and so Augustus was chosen to become Father of the Second Covenant, wherein all religious matters were now centralized in the hand of the Princeps or Emperor, and Augustus set a new high standard for ethicality and virtue. As a unifying element of the Second Covenant, the new Imperial Cult was formed, the Deified Emperors, and after Numa had reformed the inherited religion, this was the second reform. The task was to set up the Emperor as figurehead of spirituality, to give a new Unity to all the Romans, to set him up as a role model for the people. The strength of it was, that the Emperor could function both as religious and political head, and it would be very strong, when the Emperors were strong and wise. But alas, the same already contained its own weakness, that the same as before the Aristocracy used religion for political goals, so it was with the Emperors, as time passed.</p><h3>Rise of the Mystery Cults</h3><p>We can see that the spiritual desire of the masses began to shift and to develop, which was not an accident or fall, but on the contrary, a sign of spiritual progress. As the aim of religion was for the Mortal Souls to return to the Divine Home, so religion of course will have to find new forms, reform itself and adapt to the new questions of new times, as humans spiritually grow. This would have been an excellent opportunity to take up inspiration from the Mystery Cults and accept their great popularity as sign that the Roman Religion needed further development, that indeed people had outgrown the limitation of the past, and were seeking answers to personal questions, their needs, their fear, their sufferings, their hopes and dreams. But alas, as time passed the Second Covenant failed for the same reasons as the First: it failed to adapt and to pick up the subtle hints of the Gods, to incorporate the Mystery Cults and their new perspectives, as apparently was the desire of more and more people in the Roman Empire. And when Men fail to listen to the Signs given by the Gods, disaster will follow.</p><h3>The Interreligio</h3><p>The Polytheist time came aggressively to a halt, when the Christian Religion continued to sharply rise in numbers. In hindsight we can see there was ample opportunity of the Roman Cultus to adapt to the time, to understand that a developing humanity now desired more from a religion, a personal connection to the Divine, something to answer to more personal issues. And since nothing happened that is not the will of the Gods, the Gods, as a final act of demonstrating where negligence leads to, retreated from men, and the Second Covenant was broken, beginning the long Era of the Interreligio, the dominion of foreign book religions dominating us, and all offices were given to the legitimacy of the Christian Church, as a punishment for the failure of our ancestors.</p><h3>The Third Covenant</h3><p>After a millennia and a half, polytheists all over the old world have again heard the call of the Gods, and actually already centuries ago, during the era of the Renaissance, the Gods send out the first calls to mortals, making a long term move for speaking to us again. For in this you see how marvelous the Gods work through millennia and centuries, patiently watching how mortal men are again ready to listen. Thus it is now up to us to form the THIRD COVENANT, which will as before pick up forms of the inherited past of the Sacred Elders, but must reform under the guidance of the Gods themselves to be fitting for the needs and the mindset of the people now. For a Priest is also called a Bridge, a PONTIFEX, and as such, a bridge is a two-way road, a support to the people to reach for the Gods and for the Gods to find the ears, eyes, and minds of the people.</p><h3>The Liberty of the Temples</h3><p>Now what is the hallmark of the Third Covenant? Sure this is merely a beginning, and to us it is not given to set everything in place all by ourselves, for like a tall building, it will be a building of many generations, each adding to the building of Religion according to the needs and insights of their own time. One of the hallmarks of our times is that people have now become ready to seek out the connection to the Gods themselves, wherein a Priest becomes a helper, a guide, and what once was divided, the spiritual awakening in the Mystery Cults and the formality of the Public Cultus, must now be united into one and merged, so that the Religio Romana in the Third Covenant will be a union of Mystery and Cultus, where the outer form of the religion must lead the inner development of every individual, enabling each to rise spiritually and ethically by himself. That is why in the Third Covenant, all regional Temples or Groups must have the maximum of autonomy to organize the Cultus in such a form, as it is right and desired by the people of that locality or region, so that one Regional Group may seek a more traditional, another a balanced and yet another a completely reformed version of the Roman Religion, as the needs and desires of each people requires.</p><h3>The Liberty of the Individual</h3><p>As the aim of Religion is the return of the mortal's soul to its Divine Home in the company of the Gods, it is, as we advance, an ever more personal path, and while religion organizes us, to be together and share our experience and have a common basis in this worldly life, the hallmark of the Third Covenant is, that each individual must be given the chance to find his or her own connection to the Gods, and no Priest is an authority figure over it anymore. What is right is between the Cultor and his conscience before the Gods. That shall be the highest instance which outer authority shall not overrule. A Priest is a guide and a helper, not a commander or an authority figure. He gives perspective and comfort, guidance and advise, but he does not meddle or persuade, neither by fear nor false promises, for this was the lesson of the failure of the first two covenants, that authority made them fail. Nevertheless, people are encouraged to form groups and then each group shall vote on the Cultus and elect such a person as Priest, who they seem fit in accordance with their own needs.</p><h3>Becoming a Pontifex</h3><p>As it is said, Pontifex means bridge, so it is clear that a Priest serves both men and Gods, and as such a Priest must have a professional education in his profession. Since in the Third Covenant the Priests are no longer set in place by Mundane Politicians, those who seek out to be Sacerdos or Pontifex must seek out another Priest and learn from him, or he might learn from several, so that his perspective is broad. So it is only one Priest that can anoint another, so despite the fact that any local group elects their own Priests, they are advised only to chose those as Priest, who has had education and anointment from another Priest, whereas it becomes the duty of each new Priest to be ready to teach Priests in turn, which is his moral obligation as best as he can. Since we have no central authority and shall not have one, like the Jews began the Rabbinic tradition, where one Rabbi teaches the next, so shall we do, that one Priest educates the next.</p><h3>Guiding the Soul</h3><p>It is clear that it has always been the task of RELIGIO to guide the soul back to the Divine Home, to make the soul grow and elevate above the earthen limitations. It is thus vital that any Priest learns to be a helper of man, to guide and to council, to give comfort and hope, to inspire, to be at the side of the suffering and those who fear. Since all human souls are of divine origin, he thus helps each soul to return to the Divine Company from where they came, and <em>that</em> is the Service to the Gods in the most intimate and important sense, from where all outer form is just a tool to achieve the ascend of the soul of each mortal being itself. So a Pontifex of our time of the Third Covenant must be Priest <em>and</em> Philosopher, so that the guidance of form and spirit are reunited again. But be aware to guide each so he can guide himself, not to remain dependent in the Guide.</p><h3>Sola Devotio</h3><p>What enables the soul of each mortal to return to rise and one day to return to the Divine Company of the Gods, is only Devotion to the Gods alone. All other works are just by-works, seals which demonstrate the Inner Work of Devotion to the Gods. The Devotion is shown through three services: the service of Ethics, by doing good works; the service of the Cultus, by participating the ceremonies; and third the service of the Offerings, by giving something to the Gods as a gesture of your devotion. But it is neither the good works, nor the Cultus not the offerings that elevate the soul, but these are mere seals upon your devotion to the Gods, signs for your inner development, which in itself are worthless if you do not grow inside and do these all as a mere hollow gesture.</p><h3>The Unlimited Gods</h3><p>During the ancient times of King Numa, it was custom not to depict the Gods in images, for Numa had taught us, that the Gods are unlimited and unfathomable. There was in later times made a compromise and people began to adapt Statues and Images of the Gods, and this was right in order to give the average person a bridge in form of images. Still, let no man claim domain over what the Gods can and cannot do, what they will and will not do. A Priest shall not claim to utter any final will of the Gods ever. What the Gods will and what they do is theirs alone and to us is ever only given a glimpse, so we must not fall into the HUBRIS to say “this and this is not what the Gods will”, or “that is not what the Gods can do.” The Gods can do and will as they please, and it is not up to Mortal Men trying to confine the Gods in proclaiming for them, what they cannot or will not do. To the Gods, no thing is impossible, and their final council is always a mystery for us.</p><h3>Return by Love</h3><p>The Gods are looking at us always with love and they desire that every individual returns to his Divine Company from where he came. All the doings of the Gods is guided by this, whether they save or punish. So it is only love we can give as OFFERING, where from all outer offerings are merely symbols of, and it is only GRACE of the Gods, born from their love to us, that it is accepted, for the Gods have no needs, the least of it need of material sacrifice. We preserve the habit of Sacrifice merely as a lover offers flowers or gifts, not because of the value of the object, but the meaning behind it, that is the reciprocal love between Gods and Men.</p><h3>Accepting Through Insight Alone</h3><p>These Tenets which describe the cornerstones of the Third Covenant or “Reformed Roman Religion”, shall never be forced upon anyone, neither through intimidation nor persuasion against the will of another. It is right to teach and to spread the wisdom of the Cultus Deorum, as it pleases the Gods to have people reply to their love for us, but it must be accepted by clear mind and out of free will, and since Insight is always only given to each individually, so the individual stands before the Gods with his own conscience, whereto Religion and Priests can only guide and help. But since we are in this earthly life in societies, it is prudent to form a Cultus wherein the individuals walk the path to the Gods together, in a form that unites people, so they support each other, strengthened in their unity; though never at the expense to oppress the individual.</p><meta itemprop="dateCreated" content="2019-05"><p><u>Gaius Florius Aetius</u>, Maius <abbr title="ab America condita, since the founding of America">AAC</abbr> 244 (AUC 2772)</p></article>
