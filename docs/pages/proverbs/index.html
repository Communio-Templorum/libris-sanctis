A picture is worth a thousand words
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Accidents will happen in the best regulated families
Actions speak louder than words.
Adversity makes strange bedfellows
All good things come to those who wait
All good things must come to an end
All is grist that comes to the mill
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. —Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), leader of the Indian independence movement
Any port in a storm
April showers bring May flowers
As you make your bed, so you must lie upon it
As you sow, so shall you reap
Ask a silly question and you will get a silly answer
Ask my companion if I be a thief
Ask no questions and hear no lies

Bad manners are the fault of the parent, not the child
Bad news travels fast
Behind every great man, there is a great woman
Better safe than sorry
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you do not
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
Better wear out than rust out.
Big fish eat little fish
Blood is thicker than water
Brevity is the soul of wit. —William Shakespeare
Business before pleasure
Buyer beware

Caesar's wife must be above suspicion
Careless talk costs lives
Charity begins at home
Cheats never prosper
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Clothing makes the man
Cold hands, warm heart
Comparisons are odious
Count your blessings
Cowards may die many times before their death
Crime doesn't pay
Cross the stream where it is shallowest
Curiosity killed the cat

Dead men tell no tales
Devil take the hindmost
Discretion is the better part of valour
Do not bite the hand that feeds you
Do not burn your bridges behind you
Do not change horses midstream
Do not count your eggs before they hatch
Do not cross the bridge till you come to it
Do not cut off your nose to spite your face
Do not fish for a shark with your hands, fish for hands with a shark.
Do not let the grass grow beneath one's feet
Do not make a mountain out of a mole hill
Do not meet troubles half-way
Do not put the cart before the horse
Do not rock the boat
Do not spend it all in one place
Do not throw pearls to swine
Do not teach your Grandmother to suck eggs
Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater
Do not try to walk before you can crawl
Do not upset the apple-cart
Do not wash your dirty linen in public
Do not sympathize with those who can not empathize
Doubt is the beginning, not the end, of wisdom

Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. —Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790)
Easier said than done
Easy come, easy go
Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper
Eat, drink and be merry, (for tomorrow we die)
Empty vessels make the most noise
Even from a foe a man may learn wisdom.
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has his day
Every little bit helps
Every picture tells a story
Every stick has two ends
Every tide has its ebb
Everyone has their price

Faint heart never won fair lady (Scott)
Fair exchange is no robbery
Fall seven times, stand up eight
False friends are worse than open enemies
Fake it till you make it
Familiarity breeds contempt
Feed a cold and starve a fever
Fight fire with fire
Fine feathers make fine birds
Finders keepers, losers weepers
Fine words butter no parsnips
First impressions are the most lasting
Fish always rot from the head down
Fish and guests smell after three days
Flattery will get you nowhere
Fools rush in
For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for want of a horse the man was lost
Forewarned is forearmed
Fortune favours the bold
Fretting cares make grey hair
From the sublime to the ridiculous is only a step

Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
Give a man enough rope and he will hang himself
Give credit where credit is due
The Gods helps those who help themselves
Good fences make good neighbours
Good talk saves the food

Half a loaf is better than no bread
Hard cases make bad law
Hard work never did anyone any harm
Haste makes waste
He that goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing
He who hesitates is lost
He who laughs last laughs longest
He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword
He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man
He who pays the piper calls the tune
He who sups with the Devil should have a long spoon
Hindsight is twenty-twenty
Honesty is the best policy
Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.
Hope springs eternal
Horse kicking a water stand
Horses for courses
Hunger never knows the taste, sleep never knows the comfort

If anything can go wrong, it will. Also referred to as Murphy's Law
If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing right
If at first you do not succeed, try, try again
If God had meant us to fly, he would have given us wings
If ifs and ands were pots and pans, there would be no work for tinkers
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If it were not for hope the heart would break.
If the shoe fits, wear it
If the mountain will not come to Mohammed, then Mohammed must go to the mountain
If wealth is lost, nothing is lost. If health is lost, something is lost. If character is lost, everything is lost.
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you cannot beat them, join them
If you cannot live longer, live deeper.
If you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll always ask for a glass of milk
If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
If you play with fire, you will get burned.
If you want a thing done well, do it yourself
If you have never seen the bottom of the tree, you cannot know how tall it stands
Ignorance is bliss
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In for a penny, in for a pound
In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king
In the midst of life, we are in death
Into every life a little rain must fall
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It ain’t what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain’t so.
It is all grist to the mill
It is an ill wind (that blows no one any good)
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to be smarter than you appear than to appear smarter than you are.
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is like juggling sand
It is never too late
It is no use crying over spilt milk
Do not cry over spilled milk
It is no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
Do not shut/lock the stable door after the horse has bolted
It is not enough to learn how to ride, you must also learn how to fall.
It is the empty can that makes the most noise
It needs a hundred lies to cover a single lie
It takes a village to raise a child
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango

Jack of all trades, master of none
Judge not, lest ye be judged
Do not judge a book by its cover
Never judge a book by its cover

Keep your chin up
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Knock on wood
Know which side one's bread is buttered
Knowledge is power, guard it well.
A little learning is a dangerous thing
Too little knowledge makes you a danger to others.
There is no shame in not knowing; the shame lies in not finding out.
Zeal without knowledge is fire without light.

Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone
Laughter is the best medicine
Late lunch makes the day go faster.
Least said, soonest mended
Less is more
Let bygones be bygones
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Leave well enough alone
Life is what you make it
Lightning never strikes the same place twice
Little pitchers have big ears
Little things please little minds
Live and let live
Live for today, for tomorrow never comes
He who fights and runs away, may live to fight another day
Loose lips sink ships
Love is blind
Love of money is the root of all evil.
Love makes the world go round

Make love not war
Man does not live by bread alone
Manners make the man
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Memory is the treasure of the mind
Mighty oaks grow from little acorns
Misery loves company
Moderation in all things
Money earned by deceit, goes by deceit
Money demands care, you abuse it and it disappears. Rashida Costa
Money makes the world go round
Money talks
Money makes many things, but also makes devil dance
Mud sticks
Music has charms to soothe the savage breast

Nature abhors a vacuum
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Never cast a clout until May be out
Never give advice unless asked.
Never give a sucker an even break
Never let the sun go down on your anger
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Do not look a gift horse in the mouth
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Never speak ill of the dead
Never say never
Never too old to learn.
No guts, no glory
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No news is good news
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Not all those who wander are lost
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

Oil and water do not mix
Once bitten, twice shy
One half of the world does not know how the other half lives
One kind word can warm three winter months
One man's meat is another man's poison
One man's trash is another man's treasure
One might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb
One might as well throw water into the sea as to do a kindness to rogues
Open confession is good for the soul.
Opportunity never knocks twice at any man's door
Other times other manners.

Parsley seed goes nine times to the Devil
Patience is a virtue
Penny wise and pound foolish
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Practice makes perfect
Practice what you preach
Prevention is better than cure
Pride comes/goes before a fall (O.T.),
Procrastination is the thief of time
Put your best foot forward
Put your money where your mouth is

Respect is not given, it is earned.
Rome was not built in a day

Saturnalia comes but once a year
See a penny and pick it up, all day long you will have good luck; see a penny and let it lay, bad luck you will have all day
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Seeing is believing
Seek and ye shall find
Shiny are the distant hills
Shrouds have no pockets
(Speech is silver but) Silence is golden
Slow and steady wins the race
Slow but sure
Speak as you find
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Stupid is as stupid does
Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan

Take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves
Talk is cheap
Talk of the Devil, and he is bound to appear
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are
The apple does not fall/never falls far from the tree
The best defence is a good offence
The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The boy is father to the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The course of true love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
It's always darked before the dawn
The Devil finds work for idle hands to do
Idle hands are the devil's playthings.
The early bird catches the worm
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
The innocent seldom find an uncomfortable pillow. William Cowper, English poet (1731–1800)
The labourer is worthy of his hire
The longest journey starts with a single step
The more things change, the more they stay the same
The only disability in life is a bad attitude
The pen is mightier than the sword
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
The unexamined life is not worth living. —Socrates
The work praises the man.
There are none so blind as those who will not see
There are two sides to every question
There is an exception to every rule
There are always more fish in the sea
There is many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There is many a slip between cup and lip
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no accounting for taste
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no need to wear a hair shirt
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no such thing as bad publicity
Any publicity is good publicity
There is no time like the present
There are none so deaf as those who will not hear
There is safety in numbers
They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it – George Santayana
History repeats itself
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Only time will tell
To each his own.
To err is human, to forgive divine
Tomorrow is another day
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Turn your face toward the sun and the shadows fall behind you.
Two heads are better than one
Two wrongs do not make a right

Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
United we stand, divided we fall.
Up a creek without a paddle

Variety is the spice of life. William Cowper, English poet (1731–1800)
Virtue is its own reward

The walls have ears
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not, want not
Well begun is half done
What does not kill me makes me stronger
Well done is better than well said.
What cannot be cured must be endured
What goes around, comes around
What goes up must come down
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
What the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. —St. Ambrose 347AD
When it rains it pours.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
What is learned in the cradle lasts to the tomb
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is muck there is brass
Where there is life there is hope.
While there is life there is hope
Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.
Who watches the watchers? —1984
Who will bell the cat?
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
Do not keep a dog and bark yourself
With great power comes great responsibility
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good

You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You cannot always get what you want
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot push a rope
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You cannot win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pay your money and you take your choice
You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff

They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately. A faithful man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, “I trust in the Gods and I will pray to Them and make sacrifice so that They may rescue me.”</p><p>The water started to rise around his house. His neighbor cam over, urging him to leave, and offered him a ride to safety. The man yelled back, “I am waiting for the Gods to save me.” The neighbour drove off.</p><p>The man continued to pray and hold on to his vision. As the water began rising in his house, he had to climb up to the roof. A boat came by with some people heading for safe ground. They yelled at the man to jump aboard so they could take him to safety. He told them that he was waiting for the Gods to save him. They shook their heads and moved on.</p><p>The man continued to pray, believing with all his heart that he would be saved by the Gods. The flood waters continued to rise over the roof. A helicopter flew overhead and a voice came over a loudspeaker offering to lower a ladder and take him off the roof. The man waved the helicopter away, shouting back that he was waiting for the Gods to save him. The helicopter left.</p><p>The flooding water continued rising over his head, caught him up, and swept him away. He drowned.</p><p>When he reached heaven he asked, “Great Jupiter and all the eternal Gods, why did You not save me? I believed in You with all my heart. Why did You let me drown?”</p><p>Jupiter replied, “We sent you a truck, a boat, and a helicopter and you refused all of them. What else could We possibly do for you?”</p><hr><p>A pandemic ravaged the great nation. The sick people were told to stay at home so as not to spread the plague to their coworkers, friends, and family. Severe cases were given beds in the hospitals. Loved ones were not allowed near for fear of catching and spreading the plague. Even as the sick lay dying, no visitors were allowed inside and they died alone.</p><p>Every where people went, there were no sick people in the streets and the world looked as it did before. But the Scientists warned “Though the world looks the same, the plague is still spreading, so you must avoid crowds to stop the plague from spreading any further.” People were kept at home and ventured out only for food. Though some people were able to begin to do their work in their homes, many millions lost their jobs, their livelihoods.</p><p>The faithful Christians, however, continued to meet and gather in their church halls and sat close together. They denounced the invisible plague as fake and they prayed to their god to keep them safe.</p><p>More people became sick and were left in isolation. Many thousands died alone with no one to hold their hand. “Is there no way we can go outside to gather food and return to work?” many people cried.</p><p>“Yes, by wearing a face covering,” said the Scientists, “for it will hold in your breath to not spread the plague to the people around you.”</p><p>And so people put on face coverings and began to venture outside again. Every where people went, there were no sick people in the streets and the world looked as it did before. But the Scientists warned “Though the world looks the same, the plague is still spreading, so you must continue to avoid crowds and wear your face coverings to stop the spread of the plague.”</p><p>The faithful Christians, though, continued to meet and gather in their church halls. The Christians sat close together and spoke and sang loud for all to hear. The Christians denounced the invisible plague as fake and they prayed to their god to keep them safe. The Christians said their god never wore a mask and so it was abhorrent for them to wear a mask. The Christians went out into the crowds without masks and continued to gather in large groups. Their pastors cried that the plague was a hoax and told their followers that their god would save them if they just continued to pray and give to the church.</p><p>But as the Christians kept gathering, the plague continued to spread amongst them. As their pastors fell sick and withdrew to their homes, the faithful Christians continued to gather. As their loved ones fell sick, the failful Christians continued to gather. As they themselves grew sick, the faithful Christians continued to gather.</p><p>If struck with the plague and sent to the hospital, the faithful Christians would cry out “What is wrong with me? Why am I so sick? There is no plague and my god shall keep me safe, so what has stricken me and sent me to the hospital?”</p></section><section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Chapter"><h3 itemprop="name">Chinese Proverbs</h3><ol><li>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</li><li>He who loves the world as his body may be entrusted with the empire.
