</pre></section><section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Chapter"><h3 itemprop="name">Parable</h3><p>A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately. A faithful man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, “I trust in the Gods and I will pray to Them and make sacrifice so that They may rescue me.”</p><p>The water started to rise around his house. His neighbor cam over, urging him to leave, and offered him a ride to safety. The man yelled back, “I am waiting for the Gods to save me.” The neighbour drove off.</p><p>The man continued to pray and hold on to his vision. As the water began rising in his house, he had to climb up to the roof. A boat came by with some people heading for safe ground. They yelled at the man to jump aboard so they could take him to safety. He told them that he was waiting for the Gods to save him. They shook their heads and moved on.</p><p>The man continued to pray, believing with all his heart that he would be saved by the Gods. The flood waters continued to rise over the roof. A helicopter flew overhead and a voice came over a loudspeaker offering to lower a ladder and take him off the roof. The man waved the helicopter away, shouting back that he was waiting for the Gods to save him. The helicopter left.</p><p>The flooding water continued rising over his head, caught him up, and swept him away. He drowned.</p><p>When he reached heaven he asked, “Great Jupiter and all the eternal Gods, why did You not save me? I believed in You with all my heart. Why did You let me drown?”</p><p>Jupiter replied, “We sent you a truck, a boat, and a helicopter and you refused all of them. What else could We possibly do for you?”</p><hr><p>A pandemic ravaged the great nation. The sick people were told to stay at home so as not to spread the plague to their coworkers, friends, and family. Severe cases were given beds in the hospitals. Loved ones were not allowed near for fear of catching and spreading the plague. Even as the sick lay dying, no visitors were allowed inside and they died alone.</p><p>Every where people went, there were no sick people in the streets and the world looked as it did before. But the Scientists warned “Though the world looks the same, the plague is still spreading, so you must avoid crowds to stop the plague from spreading any further.” People were kept at home and ventured out only for food. Though some people were able to begin to do their work in their homes, many millions lost their jobs, their livelihoods.</p><p>The faithful Christians, however, continued to meet and gather in their church halls and sat close together. They denounced the invisible plague as fake and they prayed to their god to keep them safe.</p><p>More people became sick and were left in isolation. Many thousands died alone with no one to hold their hand. “Is there no way we can go outside to gather food and return to work?” many people cried.</p><p>“Yes, by wearing a face covering,” said the Scientists, “for it will hold in your breath to not spread the plague to the people around you.”</p><p>And so people put on face coverings and began to venture outside again. Every where people went, there were no sick people in the streets and the world looked as it did before. But the Scientists warned “Though the world looks the same, the plague is still spreading, so you must continue to avoid crowds and wear your face coverings to stop the spread of the plague.”</p><p>The faithful Christians, though, continued to meet and gather in their church halls. The Christians sat close together and spoke and sang loud for all to hear. The Christians denounced the invisible plague as fake and they prayed to their god to keep them safe. The Christians said their god never wore a mask and so it was abhorrent for them to wear a mask. The Christians went out into the crowds without masks and continued to gather in large groups. Their pastors cried that the plague was a hoax and told their followers that their god would save them if they just continued to pray and give to the church.</p><p>But as the Christians kept gathering, the plague continued to spread amongst them. As their pastors fell sick and withdrew to their homes, the faithful Christians continued to gather. As their loved ones fell sick, the failful Christians continued to gather. As they themselves grew sick, the faithful Christians continued to gather.</p><p>If struck with the plague and sent to the hospital, the faithful Christians would cry out “What is wrong with me? Why am I so sick? There is no plague and my god shall keep me safe, so what has stricken me and sent me to the hospital?”</p></section></article>
