On his shoulders he bore the skin of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">οἳ δ' ὅτε δὴ σχεδὸν ἦσαν ἐπ' ἀλλήλοισιν ἰόντες,<br>Τρωσὶν μὲν προμάχιζεν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδὴς<br>παρδαλέην ὤμοισιν ἔχων καὶ καμπύλα τόξα<br>καὶ ξίφος: αὐτὰρ δοῦρε δύω κεκορυθμένα χαλκῷ<br>πάλλων Ἀργείων προκαλίζετο πάντας ἀρίστους<br>ἀντίβιον μαχέσασθαι ἐν αἰνῇ δηϊοτῆτι.<br>τὸν δ' ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν ἀρηί̈φιλος Μενέλαος<br>ἐρχόμενον προπάροιθεν ὁμίλου μακρὰ βιβάντα,<br>ὥς τε λέων ἐχάρη μεγάλῳ ἐπὶ σώματι κύρσας<br>εὑρὼν ἢ ἔλαφον κεραὸν ἢ ἄγριον αἶγα<br>πεινάων: μάλα γάρ τε κατεσθίει, εἴ περ ἂν αὐτὸν<br>σεύωνται ταχέες τε κύνες θαλεροί τ' αἰζηοί:</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἐχάρη Μενέλαος Ἀλέξανδρον θεοειδέα<br>ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἰδών: φάτο γὰρ τίσεσθαι ἀλείτην:<br>αὐτίκα δ' ἐξ ὀχέων σὺν τεύχεσιν ἆλτο χαμᾶζε.<br>τὸν δ' ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδὴς<br>ἐν προμάχοισι φανέντα, κατεπλήγη φίλον ἦτορ,<br>ἂψ δ' ἑτάρων εἰς ἔθνος ἐχάζετο κῆρ' ἀλεείνων.<br>ὡς δ' ὅτε τίς τε δράκοντα ἰδὼν παλίνορσος ἀπέστη<br>οὔρεος ἐν βήσσῃς, ὑπό τε τρόμος ἔλλαβε γυῖα,<br>ἂψ δ' ἀνεχώρησεν, ὦχρός τέ μιν εἷλε παρειάς,<br>ὣς αὖτις καθ' ὅμιλον ἔδυ Τρώων ἀγερώχων<br>δείσας Ἀτρέος υἱὸν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδής.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Then Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs you have done them." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' Ἕκτωρ νείκεσσεν ἰδὼν αἰσχροῖς ἐπέεσσιν:<br>Δύσπαρι εἶδος ἄριστε γυναιμανὲς ἠπεροπευτὰ<br>αἴθ' ὄφελες ἄγονός τ' ἔμεναι ἄγαμός τ' ἀπολέσθαι:<br>καί κε τὸ βουλοίμην, καί κεν πολὺ κέρδιον ἦεν<br>ἢ οὕτω λώβην τ' ἔμεναι καὶ ὑπόψιον ἄλλων.<br>ἦ που καγχαλόωσι κάρη κομόωντες Ἀχαιοὶ<br>φάντες ἀριστῆα πρόμον ἔμμεναι, οὕνεκα καλὸν<br>εἶδος ἔπ', ἀλλ' οὐκ ἔστι βίη φρεσὶν οὐδέ τις ἀλκή.<br>ἦ τοιόσδε ἐὼν ἐν ποντοπόροισι νέεσσι<br>πόντον ἐπιπλώσας, ἑτάρους ἐρίηρας ἀγείρας,<br>μιχθεὶς ἀλλοδαποῖσι γυναῖκ' εὐειδέ' ἀνῆγες<br>ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης νυὸν ἀνδρῶν αἰχμητάων<br>πατρί τε σῷ μέγα πῆμα πόληί̈ τε παντί τε δήμῳ,<br>δυσμενέσιν μὲν χάρμα, κατηφείην δὲ σοὶ αὐτῷ;<br>οὐκ ἂν δὴ μείνειας ἀρηί̈φιλον Μενέλαον;<br>γνοίης χ' οἵου φωτὸς ἔχεις θαλερὴν παράκοιτιν:<br>οὐκ ἄν τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις τά τε δῶρ' Ἀφροδίτης<br>ἥ τε κόμη τό τε εἶδος ὅτ' ἐν κονίῃσι μιγείης.<br>ἀλλὰ μάλα Τρῶες δειδήμονες: ἦ τέ κεν ἤδη<br>λάϊνον ἕσσο χιτῶνα κακῶν ἕνεχ' ὅσσα ἔοργας.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the Gods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home to Argos and the land of the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' αὖτε προσέειπεν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδής:<br>Ἕκτορ ἐπεί με κατ' αἶσαν ἐνείκεσας οὐδ' ὑπὲρ αἶσαν:<br>αἰεί τοι κραδίη πέλεκυς ὥς ἐστιν ἀτειρὴς<br>ὅς τ' εἶσιν διὰ δουρὸς ὑπ' ἀνέρος ὅς ῥά τε τέχνῃ<br>νήϊον ἐκτάμνῃσιν, ὀφέλλει δ' ἀνδρὸς ἐρωήν:<br>ὣς σοὶ ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἀτάρβητος νόος ἐστί:<br>μή μοι δῶρ' ἐρατὰ πρόφερε χρυσέης Ἀφροδίτης:<br>οὔ τοι ἀπόβλητ' ἐστὶ θεῶν ἐρικυδέα δῶρα<br>ὅσσά κεν αὐτοὶ δῶσιν, ἑκὼν δ' οὐκ ἄν τις ἕλοιτο:<br>νῦν αὖτ' εἴ μ' ἐθέλεις πολεμίζειν ἠδὲ μάχεσθαι,<br>ἄλλους μὲν κάθισον Τρῶας καὶ πάντας Ἀχαιούς,<br>αὐτὰρ ἔμ' ἐν μέσσῳ καὶ ἀρηί̈φιλον Μενέλαον<br>συμβάλετ' ἀμφ' Ἑλένῃ καὶ κτήμασι πᾶσι μάχεσθαι:<br>ὁππότερος δέ κε νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται,<br>κτήμαθ' ἑλὼν εὖ πάντα γυναῖκά τε οἴκαδ' ἀγέσθω:<br>οἳ δ' ἄλλοι φιλότητα καὶ ὅρκια πιστὰ ταμόντες<br>ναίοιτε Τροίην ἐριβώλακα, τοὶ δὲ νεέσθων<br>Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον καὶ Ἀχαιί̈δα καλλιγύναικα.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, "Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφαθ', Ἕκτωρ δ' αὖτ' ἐχάρη μέγα μῦθον ἀκούσας,<br>καί ῥ' ἐς μέσσον ἰὼν Τρώων ἀνέεργε φάλαγγας<br>μέσσου δουρὸς ἑλών: τοὶ δ' ἱδρύνθησαν ἅπαντες.<br>τῷ δ' ἐπετοξάζοντο κάρη κομόωντες Ἀχαιοὶ<br>ἰοῖσίν τε τιτυσκόμενοι λάεσσί τ' ἔβαλλον:<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ μακρὸν ἄϋσεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων:<br>ἴσχεσθ' Ἀργεῖοι, μὴ βάλλετε κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν:<br>στεῦται γάρ τι ἔπος ἐρέειν κορυθαίολος Ἕκτωρ.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hear from my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφαθ', οἳ δ' ἔσχοντο μάχης ἄνεῴ τ' ἐγένοντο<br>ἐσσυμένως: Ἕκτωρ δὲ μετ' ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔειπε:<br>κέκλυτέ μευ Τρῶες καὶ ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοὶ<br>μῦθον Ἀλεξάνδροιο, τοῦ εἵνεκα νεῖκος ὄρωρεν.<br>ἄλλους μὲν κέλεται Τρῶας καὶ πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς<br>τεύχεα κάλ' ἀποθέσθαι ἐπὶ χθονὶ πουλυβοτείρῃ,<br>αὐτὸν δ' ἐν μέσσῳ καὶ ἀρηί̈φιλον Μενέλαον<br>οἴους ἀμφ' Ἑλένῃ καὶ κτήμασι πᾶσι μάχεσθαι.<br>ὁππότερος δέ κε νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται<br>κτήμαθ' ἑλὼν εὖ πάντα γυναῖκά τε οἴκαδ' ἀγέσθω:<br>οἳ δ' ἄλλοι φιλότητα καὶ ὅρκια πιστὰ τάμωμεν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the loud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφαθ', οἳ δ' ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ:<br>τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος:<br>κέκλυτε νῦν καὶ ἐμεῖο: μάλιστα γὰρ ἄλγος ἱκάνει<br>θυμὸν ἐμόν, φρονέω δὲ διακρινθήμεναι ἤδη<br>Ἀργείους καὶ Τρῶας, ἐπεὶ κακὰ πολλὰ πέπασθε<br>εἵνεκ' ἐμῆς ἔριδος καὶ Ἀλεξάνδρου ἕνεκ' ἀρχῆς:<br>ἡμέων δ' ὁπποτέρῳ θάνατος καὶ μοῖρα τέτυκται<br>τεθναίη: ἄλλοι δὲ διακρινθεῖτε τάχιστα.<br>οἴσετε ἄρν', ἕτερον λευκόν, ἑτέρην δὲ μέλαιναν,<br>Γῇ τε καὶ Ἠελίῳ: Διὶ δ' ἡμεῖς οἴσομεν ἄλλον:<br>ἄξετε δὲ Πριάμοιο βίην, ὄφρ' ὅρκια τάμνῃ<br>αὐτός, ἐπεί οἱ παῖδες ὑπερφίαλοι καὶ ἄπιστοι,<br>μή τις ὑπερβασίῃ Διὸς ὅρκια δηλήσηται.<br>αἰεὶ δ' ὁπλοτέρων ἀνδρῶν φρένες ἠερέθονται:<br>οἷς δ' ὁ γέρων μετέῃσιν ἅμα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω<br>λεύσσει, ὅπως ὄχ' ἄριστα μετ' ἀμφοτέροισι γένηται.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they thought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it down upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had said. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφαθ', οἳ δ' ἐχάρησαν Ἀχαιοί τε Τρῶές τε<br>ἐλπόμενοι παύσασθαι ὀϊζυροῦ πολέμοιο.<br>καί ῥ' ἵππους μὲν ἔρυξαν ἐπὶ στίχας, ἐκ δ' ἔβαν αὐτοί,<br>τεύχεά τ' ἐξεδύοντο: τὰ μὲν κατέθεντ' ἐπὶ γαίῃ<br>πλησίον ἀλλήλων, ὀλίγη δ' ἦν ἀμφὶς ἄρουρα:<br>Ἕκτωρ δὲ προτὶ ἄστυ δύω κήρυκας ἔπεμπε<br>καρπαλίμως ἄρνάς τε φέρειν Πρίαμόν τε καλέσσαι:<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ Ταλθύβιον προί̈ει κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων<br>νῆας ἔπι γλαφυρὰς ἰέναι, ἠδ' ἄρν' ἐκέλευεν<br>οἰσέμεναι: ὃ δ' ἄρ' οὐκ ἀπίθησ' Ἀγαμέμνονι δίῳ.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice, the fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her in her own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, "Come hither, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the the wife of him who is the victor." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Ἶρις δ' αὖθ' Ἑλένῃ λευκωλένῳ ἄγγελος ἦλθεν<br>εἰδομένη γαλόῳ Ἀντηνορίδαο δάμαρτι,<br>τὴν Ἀντηνορίδης εἶχε κρείων Ἑλικάων<br>Λαοδίκην Πριάμοιο θυγατρῶν εἶδος ἀρίστην.<br>τὴν δ' εὗρ' ἐν μεγάρῳ: ἣ δὲ μέγαν ἱστὸν ὕφαινε<br>δίπλακα πορφυρέην, πολέας δ' ἐνέπασσεν ἀέθλους<br>Τρώων θ' ἱπποδάμων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων,<br>οὕς ἑθεν εἵνεκ' ἔπασχον ὑπ' Ἄρηος παλαμάων:<br>ἀγχοῦ δ' ἱσταμένη προσέφη πόδας ὠκέα Ἶρις:<br>δεῦρ' ἴθι νύμφα φίλη, ἵνα θέσκελα ἔργα ἴδηαι<br>Τρώων θ' ἱπποδάμων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων,<br>οἳ πρὶν ἐπ' ἀλλήλοισι φέρον πολύδακρυν Ἄρηα<br>ἐν πεδίῳ ὀλοοῖο λιλαιόμενοι πολέμοιο:<br>οἳ δὴ νῦν ἕαται σιγῇ, πόλεμος δὲ πέπαυται,<br>ἀσπίσι κεκλιμένοι, παρὰ δ' ἔγχεα μακρὰ πέπηγεν.<br>αὐτὰρ Ἀλέξανδρος καὶ ἀρηί̈φιλος Μενέλαος<br>μακρῇς ἐγχείῃσι μαχήσονται περὶ σεῖο:<br>τῷ δέ κε νικήσαντι φίλη κεκλήσῃ ἄκοιτις.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Thus spoke the Goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her former husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς εἰποῦσα θεὰ γλυκὺν ἵμερον ἔμβαλε θυμῷ<br>ἀνδρός τε προτέρου καὶ ἄστεος ἠδὲ τοκήων:<br>αὐτίκα δ' ἀργεννῇσι καλυψαμένη ὀθόνῃσιν<br>ὁρμᾶτ' ἐκ θαλάμοιο τέρεν κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσα<br>οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύ' ἕποντο,<br>Αἴθρη Πιτθῆος θυγάτηρ, Κλυμένη τε βοῶπις:<br>αἶψα δ' ἔπειθ' ἵκανον ὅθι Σκαιαὶ πύλαι ἦσαν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another, "Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">οἳ δ' ἀμφὶ Πρίαμον καὶ Πάνθοον ἠδὲ Θυμοίτην<br>Λάμπόν τε Κλυτίον θ' Ἱκετάονά τ' ὄζον Ἄρηος<br>Οὐκαλέγων τε καὶ Ἀντήνωρ πεπνυμένω ἄμφω<br>ἥατο δημογέροντες ἐπὶ Σκαιῇσι πύλῃσι,<br>γήραϊ δὴ πολέμοιο πεπαυμένοι, ἀλλ' ἀγορηταὶ<br>ἐσθλοί, τεττίγεσσιν ἐοικότες οἵ τε καθ' ὕλην<br>δενδρέῳ ἐφεζόμενοι ὄπα λειριόεσσαν ἱεῖσι:<br>τοῖοι ἄρα Τρώων ἡγήτορες ἧντ' ἐπὶ πύργῳ.<br>οἳ δ' ὡς οὖν εἴδονθ' Ἑλένην ἐπὶ πύργον ἰοῦσαν,<br>ἦκα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔπεα πτερόεντ' ἀγόρευον:<br>οὐ νέμεσις Τρῶας καὶ ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιοὺς<br>τοιῇδ' ἀμφὶ γυναικὶ πολὺν χρόνον ἄλγεα πάσχειν:<br>αἰνῶς ἀθανάτῃσι θεῇς εἰς ὦπα ἔοικεν:<br>ἀλλὰ καὶ ὧς τοίη περ ἐοῦσ' ἐν νηυσὶ νεέσθω,<br>μηδ' ἡμῖν τεκέεσσί τ' ὀπίσσω πῆμα λίποιτο.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>But Priam bade her draw nigh.

It is they that have brought about this terrible war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be a king." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρ' ἔφαν, Πρίαμος δ' Ἑλένην ἐκαλέσσατο φωνῇ:<br>δεῦρο πάροιθ' ἐλθοῦσα φίλον τέκος ἵζευ ἐμεῖο,<br>ὄφρα ἴδῃ πρότερόν τε πόσιν πηούς τε φίλους τε:<br>οὔ τί μοι αἰτίη ἐσσί, θεοί νύ μοι αἴτιοί εἰσιν<br>οἵ μοι ἐφώρμησαν πόλεμον πολύδακρυν Ἀχαιῶν:<br>ὥς μοι καὶ τόνδ' ἄνδρα πελώριον ἐξονομήνῃς<br>ὅς τις ὅδ' ἐστὶν Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἠύ̈ς τε μέγας τε.<br>ἤτοι μὲν κεφαλῇ καὶ μείζονες ἄλλοι ἔασι,<br>καλὸν δ' οὕτω ἐγὼν οὔ πω ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν,<br>οὐδ' οὕτω γεραρόν: βασιλῆϊ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικε.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow.

When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, τὸν δ' ὁ γέρων ἠγάσσατο φώνησέν τε:<br>ὦ μάκαρ Ἀτρεί̈δη μοιρηγενὲς ὀλβιόδαιμον,<br>ἦ ῥά νύ τοι πολλοὶ δεδμήατο κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν.<br>ἤδη καὶ Φρυγίην εἰσήλυθον ἀμπελόεσσαν,<br>ἔνθα ἴδον πλείστους Φρύγας ἀνέρας αἰολοπώλους<br>λαοὺς Ὀτρῆος καὶ Μυγδόνος ἀντιθέοιο,<br>οἵ ῥα τότ' ἐστρατόωντο παρ' ὄχθας Σαγγαρίοιο:<br>καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπίκουρος ἐὼν μετὰ τοῖσιν ἐλέχθην<br>ἤματι τῷ ὅτε τ' ἦλθον Ἀμαζόνες ἀντιάνειραι:<br>ἀλλ' οὐδ' οἳ τόσοι ἦσαν ὅσοι ἑλίκωπες Ἀχαιοί.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>The old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who is that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the chest and shoulders?

When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses had the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δ' αὖτ' Ἀντήνωρ πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:<br>ὦ γύναι ἦ μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος νημερτὲς ἔειπες:<br>ἤδη γὰρ καὶ δεῦρό ποτ' ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς<br>σεῦ ἕνεκ' ἀγγελίης σὺν ἀρηϊφίλῳ Μενελάῳ:<br>τοὺς δ' ἐγὼ ἐξείνισσα καὶ ἐν μεγάροισι φίλησα,<br>ἀμφοτέρων δὲ φυὴν ἐδάην καὶ μήδεα πυκνά.<br>ἀλλ' ὅτε δὴ Τρώεσσιν ἐν ἀγρομένοισιν ἔμιχθεν<br>στάντων μὲν Μενέλαος ὑπείρεχεν εὐρέας ὤμους,<br>ἄμφω δ' ἑζομένω γεραρώτερος ἦεν Ὀδυσσεύς:<br>ἀλλ' ὅτε δὴ μύθους καὶ μήδεα πᾶσιν ὕφαινον<br>ἤτοι μὲν Μενέλαος ἐπιτροχάδην ἀγόρευε,<br>παῦρα μὲν ἀλλὰ μάλα λιγέως, ἐπεὶ οὐ πολύμυθος<br>οὐδ' ἀφαμαρτοεπής: ἦ καὶ γένει ὕστερος ἦεν.<br>ἀλλ' ὅτε δὴ πολύμητις ἀναί̈ξειεν Ὀδυσσεὺς<br>στάσκεν, ὑπαὶ δὲ ἴδεσκε κατὰ χθονὸς ὄμματα πήξας,<br>σκῆπτρον δ' οὔτ' ὀπίσω οὔτε προπρηνὲς ἐνώμα,<br>ἀλλ' ἀστεμφὲς ἔχεσκεν ἀί̈δρεϊ φωτὶ ἐοικώς:<br>φαίης κε ζάκοτόν τέ τιν' ἔμμεναι ἄφρονά τ' αὔτως.<br>ἀλλ' ὅτε δὴ ὄπα τε μεγάλην ἐκ στήθεος εἵη<br>καὶ ἔπεα νιφάδεσσιν ἐοικότα χειμερίῃσιν,<br>οὐκ ἂν ἔπειτ' Ὀδυσῆί̈ γ' ἐρίσσειε βροτὸς ἄλλος:<br>οὐ τότε γ' ὧδ' Ὀδυσῆος ἀγασσάμεθ' εἶδος ἰδόντες.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great and goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the Argives?" <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸ τρίτον αὖτ' Αἴαντα ἰδὼν ἐρέειν' ὃ γεραιός:<br>τίς τὰρ ὅδ' ἄλλος Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἠύ̈ς τε μέγας τε<br>ἔξοχος Ἀργείων κεφαλήν τε καὶ εὐρέας ὤμους;</rtc></ruby> <ruby>"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him.

I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself.

"Father Jove," he cried, "that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain.

Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting Gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great and glorious, and ye other everlasting Gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children- may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of strangers." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ, καὶ ἀπὸ στομάχους ἀρνῶν τάμε νηλέϊ χαλκῷ:<br>καὶ τοὺς μὲν κατέθηκεν ἐπὶ χθονὸς ἀσπαίροντας<br>θυμοῦ δευομένους: ἀπὸ γὰρ μένος εἵλετο χαλκός.<br>οἶνον δ' ἐκ κρητῆρος ἀφυσσόμενοι δεπάεσσιν<br>ἔκχεον, ἠδ' εὔχοντο θεοῖς αἰειγενέτῃσιν.<br>ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων τε:<br>Ζεῦ κύδιστε μέγιστε καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι<br>ὁππότεροι πρότεροι ὑπὲρ ὅρκια πημήνειαν<br>ὧδέ σφ' ἐγκέφαλος χαμάδις ῥέοι ὡς ὅδε οἶνος<br>αὐτῶν καὶ τεκέων, ἄλοχοι δ' ἄλλοισι δαμεῖεν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.

Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, "Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ ῥα καὶ ἐς δίφρον ἄρνας θέτο ἰσόθεος φώς,<br>ἂν δ' ἄρ' ἔβαιν' αὐτός, κατὰ δ' ἡνία τεῖνεν ὀπίσσω:<br>πὰρ δέ οἱ Ἀντήνωρ περικαλλέα βήσετο δίφρον.<br>τὼ μὲν ἄρ' ἄψορροι προτὶ Ἴλιον ἀπονέοντο:<br>Ἕκτωρ δὲ Πριάμοιο πάϊς καὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς<br>χῶρον μὲν πρῶτον διεμέτρεον, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα<br>κλήρους ἐν κυνέῃ χαλκήρεϊ πάλλον ἑλόντες,<br>ὁππότερος δὴ πρόσθεν ἀφείη χάλκεον ἔγχος.<br>λαοὶ δ' ἠρήσαντο, θεοῖσι δὲ χεῖρας ἀνέσχον,<br>ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων τε:<br>Ζεῦ πάτερ Ἴδηθεν μεδέων κύδιστε μέγιστε<br>ὁππότερος τάδε ἔργα μετ' ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκε,<br>τὸν δὸς ἀποφθίμενον δῦναι δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω,<br>ἡμῖν δ' αὖ φιλότητα καὶ ὅρκια πιστὰ γενέσθαι.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρ' ἔφαν, πάλλεν δὲ μέγας κορυθαίολος Ἕκτωρ<br>ἂψ ὁρόων: Πάριος δὲ θοῶς ἐκ κλῆρος ὄρουσεν.<br>οἳ μὲν ἔπειθ' ἵζοντο κατὰ στίχας, ἧχι ἑκάστῳ<br>ἵπποι ἀερσίποδες καὶ ποικίλα τεύχε' ἔκειτο:<br>αὐτὰρ ὅ γ' ἀμφ' ὤμοισιν ἐδύσετο τεύχεα καλὰ<br>δῖος Ἀλέξανδρος Ἑλένης πόσις ἠϋκόμοιο.<br>κνημῖδας μὲν πρῶτα περὶ κνήμῃσιν ἔθηκε<br>καλάς, ἀργυρέοισιν ἐπισφυρίοις ἀραρυίας:<br>δεύτερον αὖ θώρηκα περὶ στήθεσσιν ἔδυνεν<br>οἷο κασιγνήτοιο Λυκάονος: ἥρμοσε δ' αὐτῷ.<br>ἀμφὶ δ' ἄρ' ὤμοισιν βάλετο ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον<br>χάλκεον, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα σάκος μέγα τε στιβαρόν τε:<br>κρατὶ δ' ἐπ' ἰφθίμῳ κυνέην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκεν<br>ἵππουριν: δεινὸν δὲ λόφος καθύπερθεν ἔνευεν:<br>εἵλετο δ' ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ὅ οἱ παλάμηφιν ἀρήρει.<br>ὣς δ' αὔτως Μενέλαος ἀρήϊος ἔντε' ἔδυνεν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so. "King Jove," he said, "grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">οἳ δ' ἐπεὶ οὖν ἑκάτερθεν ὁμίλου θωρήχθησαν,<br>ἐς μέσσον Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν ἐστιχόωντο<br>δεινὸν δερκόμενοι: θάμβος δ' ἔχεν εἰσορόωντας<br>Τρῶάς θ' ἱπποδάμους καὶ ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς.<br>καί ῥ' ἐγγὺς στήτην διαμετρητῷ ἐνὶ χώρῳ<br>σείοντ' ἐγχείας ἀλλήλοισιν κοτέοντε.<br>πρόσθε δ' Ἀλέξανδρος προί̈ει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος,<br>καὶ βάλεν Ἀτρεί̈δαο κατ' ἀσπίδα πάντοσε ἴσην,<br>οὐδ' ἔρρηξεν χαλκός, ἀνεγνάμφθη δέ οἱ αἰχμὴ<br>ἀσπίδ' ἐνὶ κρατερῇ: ὃ δὲ δεύτερον ὄρνυτο χαλκῷ<br>Ἀτρεί̈δης Μενέλαος ἐπευξάμενος Διὶ πατρί:<br>Ζεῦ ἄνα δὸς τίσασθαι ὅ με πρότερος κάκ' ἔοργε<br>δῖον Ἀλέξανδρον, καὶ ἐμῇς ὑπὸ χερσὶ δάμασσον,<br>ὄφρα τις ἐρρίγῃσι καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἀνθρώπων<br>ξεινοδόκον κακὰ ῥέξαι, ὅ κεν φιλότητα παράσχῃ.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, "Father Jove, of all Gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed him." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμπεπαλὼν προί̈ει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος,<br>καὶ βάλε Πριαμίδαο κατ' ἀσπίδα πάντοσε ἴσην:<br>διὰ μὲν ἀσπίδος ἦλθε φαεινῆς ὄβριμον ἔγχος,<br>καὶ διὰ θώρηκος πολυδαιδάλου ἠρήρειστο:<br>ἀντικρὺ δὲ παραὶ λαπάρην διάμησε χιτῶνα<br>ἔγχος: ὃ δ' ἐκλίνθη καὶ ἀλεύατο κῆρα μέλαιναν.<br>Ἀτρεί̈δης δὲ ἐρυσσάμενος ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον<br>πλῆξεν ἀνασχόμενος κόρυθος φάλον: ἀμφὶ δ' ἄρ' αὐτῷ<br>τριχθά τε καὶ τετραχθὰ διατρυφὲν ἔκπεσε χειρός.<br>Ἀτρεί̈δης δ' ᾤμωξεν ἰδὼν εἰς οὐρανὸν εὐρύν:<br>Ζεῦ πάτερ οὔ τις σεῖο θεῶν ὀλοώτερος ἄλλος:<br>ἦ τ' ἐφάμην τίσασθαι Ἀλέξανδρον κακότητος:<br>νῦν δέ μοι ἐν χείρεσσιν ἄγη ξίφος, ἐκ δέ μοι ἔγχος<br>ἠί̈χθη παλάμηφιν ἐτώσιον, οὐδ' ἔβαλόν μιν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove's daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ καὶ ἐπαί̈ξας κόρυθος λάβεν ἱπποδασείης,<br>ἕλκε δ' ἐπιστρέψας μετ' ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς:<br>ἄγχε δέ μιν πολύκεστος ἱμὰς ἁπαλὴν ὑπὸ δειρήν,<br>ὅς οἱ ὑπ' ἀνθερεῶνος ὀχεὺς τέτατο τρυφαλείης.<br>καί νύ κεν εἴρυσσέν τε καὶ ἄσπετον ἤρατο κῦδος,<br>εἰ μὴ ἄρ' ὀξὺ νόησε Διὸς θυγάτηρ Ἀφροδίτη,<br>ἥ οἱ ῥῆξεν ἱμάντα βοὸς ἶφι κταμένοιο:<br>κεινὴ δὲ τρυφάλεια ἅμ' ἕσπετο χειρὶ παχείῃ.<br>τὴν μὲν ἔπειθ' ἥρως μετ' ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιοὺς<br>ῥῖψ' ἐπιδινήσας, κόμισαν δ' ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι:<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ ἂψ ἐπόρουσε κατακτάμεναι μενεαίνων<br>ἔγχεϊ χαλκείῳ: τὸν δ' ἐξήρπαξ' Ἀφροδίτη<br>ῥεῖα μάλ' ὥς τε θεός, ἐκάλυψε δ' ἄρ' ἠέρι πολλῇ,<br>κὰδ δ' εἷσ' ἐν θαλάμῳ εὐώδεϊ κηώεντι.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting down." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">αὐτὴ δ' αὖ Ἑλένην καλέουσ' ἴε: τὴν δὲ κίχανε<br>πύργῳ ἐφ' ὑψηλῷ, περὶ δὲ Τρῳαὶ ἅλις ἦσαν:<br>χειρὶ δὲ νεκταρέου ἑανοῦ ἐτίναξε λαβοῦσα,<br>γρηὶ̈ δέ μιν ἐϊκυῖα παλαιγενέϊ προσέειπεν<br>εἰροκόμῳ, ἥ οἱ Λακεδαίμονι ναιετοώσῃ<br>ἤσκειν εἴρια καλά, μάλιστα δέ μιν φιλέεσκε:<br>τῇ μιν ἐεισαμένη προσεφώνεε δῖ' Ἀφροδίτη:<br>δεῦρ' ἴθ': Ἀλέξανδρός σε καλεῖ οἶκον δὲ νέεσθαι.<br>κεῖνος ὅ γ' ἐν θαλάμῳ καὶ δινωτοῖσι λέχεσσι<br>κάλλεί̈ τε στίλβων καὶ εἵμασιν: οὐδέ κε φαίης<br>ἀνδρὶ μαχεσσάμενον τόν γ' ἐλθεῖν, ἀλλὰ χορὸν δὲ<br>ἔρχεσθ', ἠὲ χοροῖο νέον λήγοντα καθίζειν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked the beautiful neck of the Goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you thus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be Goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my mind." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, τῇ δ' ἄρα θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ὄρινε:<br>καί ῥ' ὡς οὖν ἐνόησε θεᾶς περικαλλέα δειρὴν<br>στήθεά θ' ἱμερόεντα καὶ ὄμματα μαρμαίροντα,<br>θάμβησέν τ' ἄρ' ἔπειτα ἔπος τ' ἔφατ' ἔκ τ' ὀνόμαζε:<br>δαιμονίη, τί με ταῦτα λιλαίεαι ἠπεροπεύειν;<br>ἦ πῄ με προτέρω πολίων εὖ ναιομενάων<br>ἄξεις, ἢ Φρυγίης ἢ Μῃονίης ἐρατεινῆς,<br>εἴ τίς τοι καὶ κεῖθι φίλος μερόπων ἀνθρώπων:<br>οὕνεκα δὴ νῦν δῖον Ἀλέξανδρον Μενέλαος<br>νικήσας ἐθέλει στυγερὴν ἐμὲ οἴκαδ' ἄγεσθαι,<br>τοὔνεκα δὴ νῦν δεῦρο δολοφρονέουσα παρέστης;<br>ἧσο παρ' αὐτὸν ἰοῦσα, θεῶν δ' ἀπόεικε κελεύθου,<br>μηδ' ἔτι σοῖσι πόδεσσιν ὑποστρέψειας Ὄλυμπον,<br>ἀλλ' αἰεὶ περὶ κεῖνον ὀί̈ζυε καί ἑ φύλασσε,<br>εἰς ὅ κέ σ' ἢ ἄλοχον ποιήσεται ἢ ὅ γε δούλην.<br>κεῖσε δ' ἐγὼν οὐκ εἶμι: νεμεσσητὸν δέ κεν εἴη:<br>κείνου πορσανέουσα λέχος: Τρῳαὶ δέ μ' ὀπίσσω<br>πᾶσαι μωμήσονται: ἔχω δ' ἄχε' ἄκριτα θυμῷ.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Venus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and you shall come to a bad end." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δὲ χολωσαμένη προσεφώνεε δῖ' Ἀφροδίτη:<br>μή μ' ἔρεθε σχετλίη, μὴ χωσαμένη σε μεθείω,<br>τὼς δέ σ' ἀπεχθήρω ὡς νῦν ἔκπαγλ' ἐφίλησα,<br>μέσσῳ δ' ἀμφοτέρων μητίσομαι ἔχθεα λυγρὰ<br>Τρώων καὶ Δαναῶν, σὺ δέ κεν κακὸν οἶτον ὄληαι.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and went in silence, following the Goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan women. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ', ἔδεισεν δ' Ἑλένη Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα,<br>βῆ δὲ κατασχομένη ἑανῷ ἀργῆτι φαεινῷ<br>σιγῇ, πάσας δὲ Τρῳὰς λάθεν: ἦρχε δὲ δαίμων.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving Goddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">αἳ δ' ὅτ' Ἀλεξάνδροιο δόμον περικαλλέ' ἵκοντο,<br>ἀμφίπολοι μὲν ἔπειτα θοῶς ἐπὶ ἔργα τράποντο,<br>ἣ δ' εἰς ὑψόροφον θάλαμον κίε δῖα γυναικῶν.<br>τῇ δ' ἄρα δίφρον ἑλοῦσα φιλομειδὴς Ἀφροδίτη<br>ἀντί' Ἀλεξάνδροιο θεὰ κατέθηκε φέρουσα:<br>ἔνθα κάθιζ' Ἑλένη κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο<br>ὄσσε πάλιν κλίνασα, πόσιν δ' ἠνίπαπε μύθῳ:</rtc></ruby> <ruby>"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you had fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus. go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will soon all by his spear." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἤλυθες ἐκ πολέμου: ὡς ὤφελες αὐτόθ' ὀλέσθαι<br>ἀνδρὶ δαμεὶς κρατερῷ, ὃς ἐμὸς πρότερος πόσις ἦεν.<br>ἦ μὲν δὴ πρίν γ' εὔχε' ἀρηϊφίλου Μενελάου<br>σῇ τε βίῃ καὶ χερσὶ καὶ ἔγχεϊ φέρτερος εἶναι:<br>ἀλλ' ἴθι νῦν προκάλεσσαι ἀρηί̈φιλον Μενέλαον<br>ἐξαῦτις μαχέσασθαι ἐναντίον: ἀλλά σ' ἔγωγε<br>παύεσθαι κέλομαι, μηδὲ ξανθῷ Μενελάῳ<br>ἀντίβιον πόλεμον πολεμίζειν ἠδὲ μάχεσθαι<br>ἀφραδέως, μή πως τάχ' ὑπ' αὐτοῦ δουρὶ δαμήῃς.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>And Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another time I may myself be victor, for I too have Gods that will stand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you- not even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now." On this he led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δὲ Πάρις μύθοισιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε:<br>μή με γύναι χαλεποῖσιν ὀνείδεσι θυμὸν ἔνιπτε:<br>νῦν μὲν γὰρ Μενέλαος ἐνίκησεν σὺν Ἀθήνῃ,<br>κεῖνον δ' αὖτις ἐγώ: πάρα γὰρ θεοί εἰσι καὶ ἡμῖν.<br>ἀλλ' ἄγε δὴ φιλότητι τραπείομεν εὐνηθέντε:<br>οὐ γάρ πώ ποτέ μ' ὧδέ γ' ἔρως φρένας ἀμφεκάλυψεν,<br>οὐδ' ὅτε σε πρῶτον Λακεδαίμονος ἐξ ἐρατεινῆς<br>ἔπλεον ἁρπάξας ἐν ποντοπόροισι νέεσσι,<br>νήσῳ δ' ἐν Κραναῇ ἐμίγην φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ,<br>ὥς σεο νῦν ἔραμαι καί με γλυκὺς ἵμερος αἱρεῖ.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus strode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be born hereafter." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ ῥα, καὶ ἄρχε λέχος δὲ κιών: ἅμα δ' εἵπετ' ἄκοιτις.<br><br>τὼ μὲν ἄρ' ἐν τρητοῖσι κατεύνασθεν λεχέεσσιν,<br>Ἀτρεί̈δης δ' ἀν' ὅμιλον ἐφοίτα θηρὶ ἐοικὼς<br>εἴ που ἐσαθρήσειεν Ἀλέξανδρον θεοειδέα.<br>ἀλλ' οὔ τις δύνατο Τρώων κλειτῶν τ' ἐπικούρων<br>δεῖξαι Ἀλέξανδρον τότ' ἀρηϊφίλῳ Μενελάῳ:<br>οὐ μὲν γὰρ φιλότητί γ' ἐκεύθανον εἴ τις ἴδοιτο:<br>ἶσον γάρ σφιν πᾶσιν ἀπήχθετο κηρὶ μελαίνῃ.<br>τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων:<br>κέκλυτέ μευ Τρῶες καὶ Δάρδανοι ἠδ' ἐπίκουροι:<br>νίκη μὲν δὴ φαίνετ' ἀρηϊφίλου Μενελάου,<br>ὑμεῖς δ' Ἀργείην Ἑλένην καὶ κτήμαθ' ἅμ' αὐτῇ<br>ἔκδοτε, καὶ τιμὴν ἀποτινέμεν ἥν τιν' ἔοικεν,<br>ἥ τε καὶ ἐσσομένοισι μετ' ἀνθρώποισι πέληται.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ' Ἀτρεί̈δης, ἐπὶ δ' ᾔνεον ἄλλοι Ἀχαιοί.</rtc></ruby></ol><nav><a href="#!/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/iliad/book2/" rel="prev">Previous</a> <a href="#!/iliad/book4/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><small>Translated by <u>Samuel Butler</u>, <span itemprop="copyrightYear">1898</span>.<br/>Original Greek and English translation are in public domain.</small></article>
