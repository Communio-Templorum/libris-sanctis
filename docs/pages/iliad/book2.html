In the end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to the ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the Gods; Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἄλλοι μέν ῥα θεοί τε καὶ ἀνέρες ἱπποκορυσταὶ<br>εὗδον παννύχιοι, Δία δ' οὐκ ἔχε νήδυμος ὕπνος,<br>ἀλλ' ὅ γε μερμήριζε κατὰ φρένα ὡς Ἀχιλῆα<br>τιμήσῃ, ὀλέσῃ δὲ πολέας ἐπὶ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν.<br>ἥδε δέ οἱ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή,<br>πέμψαι ἐπ' Ἀτρεί̈δῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι οὖλον ὄνειρον:<br>καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:<br>βάσκ' ἴθι οὖλε ὄνειρε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν:<br>ἐλθὼν ἐς κλισίην Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεί̈δαο<br>πάντα μάλ' ἀτρεκέως ἀγορευέμεν ὡς ἐπιτέλλω:<br>θωρῆξαί ἑ κέλευε κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιοὺς<br>πανσυδίῃ: νῦν γάρ κεν ἕλοι πόλιν εὐρυάγυιαν<br>Τρώων: οὐ γὰρ ἔτ' ἀμφὶς Ὀλύμπια δώματ' ἔχοντες<br>ἀθάνατοι φράζονται: ἐπέγναμψεν γὰρ ἅπαντας<br>Ἥρη λισσομένη, Τρώεσσι δὲ κήδε' ἐφῆπται.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above all his councillors, and said: <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, βῆ δ' ἄρ' ὄνειρος ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσε: καρπαλίμως δ' ἵκανε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν, βῆ δ' ἄρ' ἐπ' Ἀτρεί̈δην Ἀγαμέμνονα: τὸν δὲ κίχανεν εὕδοντ' ἐν κλισίῃ, περὶ δ' ἀμβρόσιος κέχυθ' ὕπνος. στῆ δ' ἄρ' ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς Νηληί̈ῳ υἷι ἐοικώς Νέστορι, τόν ῥα μάλιστα γερόντων τῖ' Ἀγαμέμνων: τῷ μιν ἐεισάμενος προσεφώνεε θεῖος ὄνειρος:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep.

He thought that on that same day he was to take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπεβήσετο, τὸν δὲ λίπ' αὐτοῦ<br>τὰ φρονέοντ' ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἅ ῥ' οὐ τελέεσθαι ἔμελλον:<br>φῆ γὰρ ὅ γ' αἱρήσειν Πριάμου πόλιν ἤματι κείνῳ<br>νήπιος, οὐδὲ τὰ ᾔδη ἅ ῥα Ζεὺς μήδετο ἔργα:<br>θήσειν γὰρ ἔτ' ἔμελλεν ἐπ' ἄλγεά τε στοναχάς τε<br>Τρωσί τε καὶ Δαναοῖσι διὰ κρατερὰς ὑσμίνας.<br>ἔγρετο δ' ἐξ ὕπνου, θείη δέ μιν ἀμφέχυτ' ὀμφή:<br>ἕζετο δ' ὀρθωθείς, μαλακὸν δ' ἔνδυνε χιτῶνα<br>καλὸν νηγάτεον, περὶ δὲ μέγα βάλλετο φᾶρος:<br>ποσσὶ δ' ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,<br>ἀμφὶ δ' ἄρ' ὤμοισιν βάλετο ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον:<br>εἵλετο δὲ σκῆπτρον πατρώϊον ἄφθιτον αἰεὶ<br>σὺν τῷ ἔβη κατὰ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>The Goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἠὼς μέν ῥα θεὰ προσεβήσετο μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον<br>Ζηνὶ φόως ἐρέουσα καὶ ἄλλοις ἀθανάτοισιν:<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ κηρύκεσσι λιγυφθόγγοισι κέλευσε<br>κηρύσσειν ἀγορὴν δὲ κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιούς:<br>οἳ μὲν ἐκήρυσσον, τοὶ δ' ἠγείροντο μάλ' ὦκα:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the dead of night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's.

There are no longer divided counsels among the Gods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others go about among the host and prevent their doing so." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">βουλὴν δὲ πρῶτον μεγαθύμων ἷζε γερόντων<br>Νεστορέῃ παρὰ νηὶ̈ Πυλοιγενέος βασιλῆος:<br>τοὺς ὅ γε συγκαλέσας πυκινὴν ἀρτύνετο βουλήν:<br>κλῦτε φίλοι: θεῖός μοι ἐνύπνιον ἦλθεν ὄνειρος<br>ἀμβροσίην διὰ νύκτα: μάλιστα δὲ Νέστορι δίῳ<br>εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε φυήν τ' ἄγχιστα ἐῴκει:<br>στῆ δ' ἄρ' ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί με πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν:<br>εὕδεις Ἀτρέος υἱὲ δαί̈φρονος ἱπποδάμοιο:<br>οὐ χρὴ παννύχιον εὕδειν βουληφόρον ἄνδρα,<br>ᾧ λαοί τ' ἐπιτετράφαται καὶ τόσσα μέμηλε:<br>νῦν δ' ἐμέθεν ξύνες ὦκα: Διὸς δέ τοι ἄγγελός εἰμι,<br>ὃς σεῦ ἄνευθεν ἐὼν μέγα κήδεται ἠδ' ἐλεαίρει:<br>θωρῆξαί σε κέλευσε κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιοὺς<br>πανσυδίῃ: νῦν γάρ κεν ἕλοις πόλιν εὐρυάγυιαν<br>Τρώων: οὐ γὰρ ἔτ' ἀμφὶς Ὀλύμπια δώματ' ἔχοντες<br>ἀθάνατοι φράζονται: ἐπέγναμψεν γὰρ ἅπαντας<br>Ἥρη λισσομένη, Τρώεσσι δὲ κήδε' ἐφῆπται<br>ἐκ Διός: ἀλλὰ σὺ σῇσιν ἔχε φρεσίν: ὣς ὃ μὲν εἰπὼν<br>ᾤχετ' ἀποπτάμενος, ἐμὲ δὲ γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἀνῆκεν.<br>ἀλλ' ἄγετ' αἴ κέν πως θωρήξομεν υἷας Ἀχαιῶν:<br>πρῶτα δ' ἐγὼν ἔπεσιν πειρήσομαι, ἣ θέμις ἐστί,<br>καὶ φεύγειν σὺν νηυσὶ πολυκλήϊσι κελεύσω:<br>ὑμεῖς δ' ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος ἐρητύειν ἐπέεσσιν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he, "princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἤτοι ὅ γ' ὣς εἰπὼν κατ' ἄρ' ἕζετο, τοῖσι δ' ἀνέστη<br>Νέστωρ, ὅς ῥα Πύλοιο ἄναξ ἦν ἠμαθόεντος,<br>ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν:<br>ὦ φίλοι Ἀργείων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες<br>εἰ μέν τις τὸν ὄνειρον Ἀχαιῶν ἄλλος ἔνισπε<br>ψεῦδός κεν φαῖμεν καὶ νοσφιζοίμεθα μᾶλλον:<br>νῦν δ' ἴδεν ὃς μέγ' ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν εὔχεται εἶναι:<br>ἀλλ' ἄγετ' αἴ κέν πως θωρήξομεν υἷας Ἀχαιῶν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at last they were got into their several places and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας βουλῆς ἐξῆρχε νέεσθαι,<br>οἳ δ' ἐπανέστησαν πείθοντό τε ποιμένι λαῶν<br>σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες: ἐπεσσεύοντο δὲ λαοί.<br>ἠύ̈τε ἔθνεα εἶσι μελισσάων ἁδινάων<br>πέτρης ἐκ γλαφυρῆς αἰεὶ νέον ἐρχομενάων,<br>βοτρυδὸν δὲ πέτονται ἐπ' ἄνθεσιν εἰαρινοῖσιν:<br>αἳ μέν τ' ἔνθα ἅλις πεποτήαται, αἳ δέ τε ἔνθα:<br>ὣς τῶν ἔθνεα πολλὰ νεῶν ἄπο καὶ κλισιάων<br>ἠϊόνος προπάροιθε βαθείης ἐστιχόωντο<br>ἰλαδὸν εἰς ἀγορήν: μετὰ δέ σφισιν ὄσσα δεδήει<br>ὀτρύνουσ' ἰέναι Διὸς ἄγγελος: οἳ δ' ἀγέροντο.<br>τετρήχει δ' ἀγορή, ὑπὸ δὲ στεναχίζετο γαῖα<br>λαῶν ἱζόντων, ὅμαδος δ' ἦν: ἐννέα δέ σφεας<br>κήρυκες βοόωντες ἐρήτυον, εἴ ποτ' ἀϋτῆς<br>σχοίατ', ἀκούσειαν δὲ διοτρεφέων βασιλήων.<br>σπουδῇ δ' ἕζετο λαός, ἐρήτυθεν δὲ καθ' ἕδρας<br>παυσάμενοι κλαγγῆς: ἀνὰ δὲ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων<br>ἔστη σκῆπτρον ἔχων τὸ μὲν Ἥφαιστος κάμε τεύχων.<br>Ἥφαιστος μὲν δῶκε Διὶ Κρονίωνι ἄνακτι,<br>αὐτὰρ ἄρα Ζεὺς δῶκε διακτόρῳ ἀργεϊφόντῃ:<br>Ἑρμείας δὲ ἄναξ δῶκεν Πέλοπι πληξίππῳ,<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ αὖτε Πέλοψ δῶκ' Ἀτρέϊ ποιμένι λαῶν,<br>Ἀτρεὺς δὲ θνῄσκων ἔλιπεν πολύαρνι Θυέστῃ,<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ αὖτε Θυέστ' Ἀγαμέμνονι λεῖπε φορῆναι,<br>πολλῇσιν νήσοισι καὶ Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν.<br>τῷ ὅ γ' ἐρεισάμενος ἔπε' Ἀργείοισι μετηύδα:</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the roll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὦ φίλοι ἥρωες Δαναοὶ θεράποντες Ἄρηος<br>Ζεύς με μέγα Κρονίδης ἄτῃ ἐνέδησε βαρείῃ,<br>σχέτλιος, ὃς πρὶν μέν μοι ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσεν<br>Ἴλιον ἐκπέρσαντ' εὐτείχεον ἀπονέεσθαι,<br>νῦν δὲ κακὴν ἀπάτην βουλεύσατο, καί με κελεύει<br>δυσκλέα Ἄργος ἱκέσθαι, ἐπεὶ πολὺν ὤλεσα λαόν.<br>οὕτω που Διὶ μέλλει ὑπερμενέϊ φίλον εἶναι,<br>ὃς δὴ πολλάων πολίων κατέλυσε κάρηνα<br>ἠδ' ἔτι καὶ λύσει: τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον.<br>αἰσχρὸν γὰρ τόδε γ' ἐστὶ καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι<br>μὰψ οὕτω τοιόνδε τοσόνδε τε λαὸν Ἀχαιῶν<br>ἄπρηκτον πόλεμον πολεμίζειν ἠδὲ μάχεσθαι<br>ἀνδράσι παυροτέροισι, τέλος δ' οὔ πώ τι πέφανται:<br>εἴ περ γάρ κ' ἐθέλοιμεν Ἀχαιοί τε Τρῶές τε<br>ὅρκια πιστὰ ταμόντες ἀριθμηθήμεναι ἄμφω,<br>Τρῶας μὲν λέξασθαι ἐφέστιοι ὅσσοι ἔασιν,<br>ἡμεῖς δ' ἐς δεκάδας διακοσμηθεῖμεν Ἀχαιοί,<br>Τρώων δ' ἄνδρα ἕκαστοι ἑλοίμεθα οἰνοχοεύειν,<br>πολλαί κεν δεκάδες δευοίατο οἰνοχόοιο.<br>τόσσον ἐγώ φημι πλέας ἔμμεναι υἷας Ἀχαιῶν<br>Τρώων, οἳ ναίουσι κατὰ πτόλιν: ἀλλ' ἐπίκουροι<br>πολλέων ἐκ πολίων ἐγχέσπαλοι ἄνδρες ἔασιν,<br>οἵ με μέγα πλάζουσι καὶ οὐκ εἰῶσ' ἐθέλοντα<br>Ἰλίου ἐκπέρσαι εὖ ναιόμενον πτολίεθρον.<br>ἐννέα δὴ βεβάασι Διὸς μεγάλου ἐνιαυτοί,<br>καὶ δὴ δοῦρα σέσηπε νεῶν καὶ σπάρτα λέλυνται:<br>αἳ δέ που ἡμέτεραί τ' ἄλοχοι καὶ νήπια τέκνα<br>εἵατ' ἐνὶ μεγάροις ποτιδέγμεναι: ἄμμι δὲ ἔργον<br>αὔτως ἀκράαντον οὗ εἵνεκα δεῦρ' ἱκόμεσθα.<br>ἀλλ' ἄγεθ' ὡς ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω πειθώμεθα πάντες:<br>φεύγωμεν σὺν νηυσὶ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν:<br>οὐ γὰρ ἔτι Τροίην αἱρήσομεν εὐρυάγυιαν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon.

They cheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, τοῖσι δὲ θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ὄρινε<br>πᾶσι μετὰ πληθὺν ὅσοι οὐ βουλῆς ἐπάκουσαν:<br>κινήθη δ' ἀγορὴ φὴ κύματα μακρὰ θαλάσσης<br>πόντου Ἰκαρίοιο, τὰ μέν τ' Εὖρός τε Νότος τε<br>ὤρορ' ἐπαί̈ξας πατρὸς Διὸς ἐκ νεφελάων.<br>ὡς δ' ὅτε κινήσῃ Ζέφυρος βαθὺ λήϊον ἐλθὼν<br>λάβρος ἐπαιγίζων, ἐπί τ' ἠμύει ἀσταχύεσσιν,<br>ὣς τῶν πᾶσ' ἀγορὴ κινήθη: τοὶ δ' ἀλαλητῷ<br>νῆας ἔπ' ἐσσεύοντο, ποδῶν δ' ὑπένερθε κονίη<br>ἵστατ' ἀειρομένη: τοὶ δ' ἀλλήλοισι κέλευον<br>ἅπτεσθαι νηῶν ἠδ' ἑλκέμεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν,<br>οὐρούς τ' ἐξεκάθαιρον: ἀϋτὴ δ' οὐρανὸν ἷκεν<br>οἴκαδε ἱεμένων: ὑπὸ δ' ᾕρεον ἕρματα νηῶν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was not fated.

We were not all of us at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is with them." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὅν τινα μὲν βασιλῆα καὶ ἔξοχον ἄνδρα κιχείη<br>τὸν δ' ἀγανοῖς ἐπέεσσιν ἐρητύσασκε παραστάς:<br>δαιμόνι' οὔ σε ἔοικε κακὸν ὣς δειδίσσεσθαι,<br>ἀλλ' αὐτός τε κάθησο καὶ ἄλλους ἵδρυε λαούς:<br>οὐ γάρ πω σάφα οἶσθ' οἷος νόος Ἀτρεί̈ωνος:<br>νῦν μὲν πειρᾶται, τάχα δ' ἴψεται υἷας Ἀχαιῶν.<br>ἐν βουλῇ δ' οὐ πάντες ἀκούσαμεν οἷον ἔειπε.<br>μή τι χολωσάμενος ῥέξῃ κακὸν υἷας Ἀχαιῶν:<br>θυμὸς δὲ μέγας ἐστὶ διοτρεφέων βασιλήων,<br>τιμὴ δ' ἐκ Διός ἐστι, φιλεῖ δέ ἑ μητίετα Ζεύς.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, hold your peace, and listen to better men than yourself.

He was the ugliest man of all those that came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon.

It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or no.

True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore, my friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of Calchas were false or true. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Ἀτρεί̈δη νῦν δή σε ἄναξ ἐθέλουσιν Ἀχαιοὶ<br>πᾶσιν ἐλέγχιστον θέμεναι μερόπεσσι βροτοῖσιν,<br>οὐδέ τοι ἐκτελέουσιν ὑπόσχεσιν ἥν περ ὑπέσταν<br>ἐνθάδ' ἔτι στείχοντες ἀπ' Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο<br>Ἴλιον ἐκπέρσαντ' εὐτείχεον ἀπονέεσθαι.<br>ὥς τε γὰρ ἢ παῖδες νεαροὶ χῆραί τε γυναῖκες<br>ἀλλήλοισιν ὀδύρονται οἶκον δὲ νέεσθαι.<br>ἦ μὴν καὶ πόνος ἐστὶν ἀνιηθέντα νέεσθαι:<br>καὶ γάρ τίς θ' ἕνα μῆνα μένων ἀπὸ ἧς ἀλόχοιο<br>ἀσχαλάᾳ σὺν νηὶ̈ πολυζύγῳ, ὅν περ ἄελλαι<br>χειμέριαι εἰλέωσιν ὀρινομένη τε θάλασσα:<br>ἡμῖν δ' εἴνατός ἐστι περιτροπέων ἐνιαυτὸς<br>ἐνθάδε μιμνόντεσσι: τὼ οὐ νεμεσίζομ' Ἀχαιοὺς<br>ἀσχαλάαν παρὰ νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν: ἀλλὰ καὶ ἔμπης<br>αἰσχρόν τοι δηρόν τε μένειν κενεόν τε νέεσθαι.<br>τλῆτε φίλοι, καὶ μείνατ' ἐπὶ χρόνον ὄφρα δαῶμεν<br>ἢ ἐτεὸν Κάλχας μαντεύεται ἦε καὶ οὐκί.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs to the Gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.' This was what he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take the city of Priam." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">εὖ γὰρ δὴ τόδε ἴδμεν ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἐστὲ δὲ πάντες<br>μάρτυροι, οὓς μὴ κῆρες ἔβαν θανάτοιο φέρουσαι:<br>χθιζά τε καὶ πρωί̈ζ' ὅτ' ἐς Αὐλίδα νῆες Ἀχαιῶν<br>ἠγερέθοντο κακὰ Πριάμῳ καὶ Τρωσὶ φέρουσαι,<br>ἡμεῖς δ' ἀμφὶ περὶ κρήνην ἱεροὺς κατὰ βωμοὺς<br>ἕρδομεν ἀθανάτοισι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας<br>καλῇ ὑπὸ πλατανίστῳ ὅθεν ῥέεν ἀγλαὸν ὕδωρ:<br>ἔνθ' ἐφάνη μέγα σῆμα: δράκων ἐπὶ νῶτα δαφοινὸς<br>σμερδαλέος, τόν ῥ' αὐτὸς Ὀλύμπιος ἧκε φόως δέ,<br>βωμοῦ ὑπαί̈ξας πρός ῥα πλατάνιστον ὄρουσεν.<br>ἔνθα δ' ἔσαν στρουθοῖο νεοσσοί, νήπια τέκνα,<br>ὄζῳ ἐπ' ἀκροτάτῳ πετάλοις ὑποπεπτηῶτες<br>ὀκτώ, ἀτὰρ μήτηρ ἐνάτη ἦν ἣ τέκε τέκνα:<br>ἔνθ' ὅ γε τοὺς ἐλεεινὰ κατήσθιε τετριγῶτας:<br>μήτηρ δ' ἀμφεποτᾶτο ὀδυρομένη φίλα τέκνα:<br>τὴν δ' ἐλελιξάμενος πτέρυγος λάβεν ἀμφιαχυῖαν.<br>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ τέκνα φάγε στρουθοῖο καὶ αὐτήν,<br>τὸν μὲν ἀρίζηλον θῆκεν θεὸς ὅς περ ἔφηνε:<br>λᾶαν γάρ μιν ἔθηκε Κρόνου πάϊς ἀγκυλομήτεω:<br>ἡμεῖς δ' ἑσταότες θαυμάζομεν οἷον ἐτύχθη.<br>ὡς οὖν δεινὰ πέλωρα θεῶν εἰσῆλθ' ἑκατόμβας,<br>Κάλχας δ' αὐτίκ' ἔπειτα θεοπροπέων ἀγόρευε:<br>τίπτ' ἄνεῳ ἐγένεσθε κάρη κομόωντες Ἀχαιοί;<br>ἡμῖν μὲν τόδ' ἔφηνε τέρας μέγα μητίετα Ζεὺς<br>ὄψιμον ὀψιτέλεστον, ὅου κλέος οὔ ποτ' ὀλεῖται.<br>ὡς οὗτος κατὰ τέκνα φάγε στρουθοῖο καὶ αὐτὴν<br>ὀκτώ, ἀτὰρ μήτηρ ἐνάτη ἦν ἣ τέκε τέκνα,<br>ὣς ἡμεῖς τοσσαῦτ' ἔτεα πτολεμίξομεν αὖθι,<br>τῷ δεκάτῳ δὲ πόλιν αἱρήσομεν εὐρυάγυιαν.<br>κεῖνος τὼς ἀγόρευε: τὰ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται.<br>ἀλλ' ἄγε μίμνετε πάντες ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοὶ<br>αὐτοῦ εἰς ὅ κεν ἄστυ μέγα Πριάμοιο ἕλωμεν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame on you," he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you should fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ', Ἀργεῖοι δὲ μέγ' ἴαχον, ἀμφὶ δὲ νῆες<br>σμερδαλέον κονάβησαν ἀϋσάντων ὑπ' Ἀχαιῶν,<br>μῦθον ἐπαινήσαντες Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο:<br>τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ:<br>ὦ πόποι ἦ δὴ παισὶν ἐοικότες ἀγοράασθε<br>νηπιάχοις οἷς οὔ τι μέλει πολεμήϊα ἔργα.<br>πῇ δὴ συνθεσίαι τε καὶ ὅρκια βήσεται ἥμιν;<br>ἐν πυρὶ δὴ βουλαί τε γενοίατο μήδεά τ' ἀνδρῶν<br>σπονδαί τ' ἄκρητοι καὶ δεξιαί, ᾗς ἐπέπιθμεν:<br>αὔτως γὰρ ἐπέεσσ' ἐριδαίνομεν, οὐδέ τι μῆχος<br>εὑρέμεναι δυνάμεσθα, πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδ' ἐόντες.<br>Ἀτρεί̈δη σὺ δ' ἔθ' ὡς πρὶν ἔχων ἀστεμφέα βουλὴν<br>ἄρχευ' Ἀργείοισι κατὰ κρατερὰς ὑσμίνας,<br>τούσδε δ' ἔα φθινύθειν ἕνα καὶ δύο, τοί κεν Ἀχαιῶν<br>νόσφιν βουλεύωσ': ἄνυσις δ' οὐκ ἔσσεται αὐτῶν:<br>πρὶν Ἄργος δ' ἰέναι πρὶν καὶ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο<br>γνώμεναι εἴ τε ψεῦδος ὑπόσχεσις εἴ τε καὶ οὐκί.<br>φημὶ γὰρ οὖν κατανεῦσαι ὑπερμενέα Κρονίωνα<br>ἤματι τῷ ὅτε νηυσὶν ἐν ὠκυπόροισιν ἔβαινον<br>Ἀργεῖοι Τρώεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φέροντες<br>ἀστράπτων ἐπιδέξι' ἐναίσιμα σήματα φαίνων.<br>τὼ μή τις πρὶν ἐπειγέσθω οἶκον δὲ νέεσθαι<br>πρίν τινα πὰρ Τρώων ἀλόχῳ κατακοιμηθῆναι,<br>τίσασθαι δ' Ἑλένης ὁρμήματά τε στοναχάς τε.<br>εἰ δέ τις ἐκπάγλως ἐθέλει οἶκον δὲ νέεσθαι<br>ἁπτέσθω ἧς νηὸς ἐϋσσέλμοιο μελαίνης,<br>ὄφρα πρόσθ' ἄλλων θάνατον καὶ πότμον ἐπίσπῃ.<br>ἀλλὰ ἄναξ αὐτός τ' εὖ μήδεο πείθεό τ' ἄλλῳ:<br>οὔ τοι ἀπόβλητον ἔπος ἔσσεται ὅττί κεν εἴπω:<br>κρῖν' ἄνδρας κατὰ φῦλα κατὰ φρήτρας Ἀγάμεμνον,<br>ὡς φρήτρη φρήτρηφιν ἀρήγῃ, φῦλα δὲ φύλοις.<br>εἰ δέ κεν ὣς ἕρξῃς καί τοι πείθωνται Ἀχαιοί,<br>γνώσῃ ἔπειθ' ὅς θ' ἡγεμόνων κακὸς ὅς τέ νυ λαῶν<br>ἠδ' ὅς κ' ἐσθλὸς ἔῃσι: κατὰ σφέας γὰρ μαχέονται.<br>γνώσεαι δ' εἰ καὶ θεσπεσίῃ πόλιν οὐκ ἀλαπάξεις,<br>ἦ ἀνδρῶν κακότητι καὶ ἀφραδίῃ πολέμοιο.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of the Achaeans in counsel.

The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to dogs and vultures." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων:<br>ἦ μὰν αὖτ' ἀγορῇ νικᾷς γέρον υἷας Ἀχαιῶν.<br>αἲ γὰρ Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον<br>τοιοῦτοι δέκα μοι συμφράδμονες εἶεν Ἀχαιῶν:<br>τώ κε τάχ' ἠμύσειε πόλις Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος<br>χερσὶν ὑφ' ἡμετέρῃσιν ἁλοῦσά τε περθομένη τε.<br>ἀλλά μοι αἰγίοχος Κρονίδης Ζεὺς ἄλγε' ἔδωκεν,<br>ὅς με μετ' ἀπρήκτους ἔριδας καὶ νείκεα βάλλει.<br>καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼν Ἀχιλεύς τε μαχεσσάμεθ' εἵνεκα κούρης<br>ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσιν, ἐγὼ δ' ἦρχον χαλεπαίνων:<br>εἰ δέ ποτ' ἔς γε μίαν βουλεύσομεν, οὐκέτ' ἔπειτα<br>Τρωσὶν ἀνάβλησις κακοῦ ἔσσεται οὐδ' ἠβαιόν.<br>νῦν δ' ἔρχεσθ' ἐπὶ δεῖπνον ἵνα ξυνάγωμεν Ἄρηα.<br>εὖ μέν τις δόρυ θηξάσθω, εὖ δ' ἀσπίδα θέσθω,<br>εὖ δέ τις ἵπποισιν δεῖπνον δότω ὠκυπόδεσσιν,<br>εὖ δέ τις ἅρματος ἀμφὶς ἰδὼν πολέμοιο μεδέσθω,<br>ὥς κε πανημέριοι στυγερῷ κρινώμεθ' Ἄρηϊ.<br>οὐ γὰρ παυσωλή γε μετέσσεται οὐδ' ἠβαιὸν<br>εἰ μὴ νὺξ ἐλθοῦσα διακρινέει μένος ἀνδρῶν.<br>ἱδρώσει μέν τευ τελαμὼν ἀμφὶ στήθεσφιν<br>ἀσπίδος ἀμφιβρότης, περὶ δ' ἔγχεϊ χεῖρα καμεῖται:<br>ἱδρώσει δέ τευ ἵππος ἐύ̈ξοον ἅρμα τιταίνων.<br>ὃν δέ κ' ἐγὼν ἀπάνευθε μάχης ἐθέλοντα νοήσω<br>μιμνάζειν παρὰ νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν, οὔ οἱ ἔπειτα<br>ἄρκιον ἐσσεῖται φυγέειν κύνας ἠδ' οἰωνούς.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves run high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted their fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the Gods, and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Ulysses, peer of Gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying, "Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ', Ἀργεῖοι δὲ μέγ' ἴαχον ὡς ὅτε κῦμα<br>ἀκτῇ ἐφ' ὑψηλῇ, ὅτε κινήσῃ Νότος ἐλθών,<br>προβλῆτι σκοπέλῳ: τὸν δ' οὔ ποτε κύματα λείπει<br>παντοίων ἀνέμων, ὅτ' ἂν ἔνθ' ἢ ἔνθα γένωνται.<br>ἀνστάντες δ' ὀρέοντο κεδασθέντες κατὰ νῆας,<br>κάπνισσάν τε κατὰ κλισίας, καὶ δεῖπνον ἕλοντο.<br>ἄλλος δ' ἄλλῳ ἔρεζε θεῶν αἰειγενετάων<br>εὐχόμενος θάνατόν τε φυγεῖν καὶ μῶλον Ἄρηος.<br>αὐτὰρ ὃ βοῦν ἱέρευσε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων<br>πίονα πενταέτηρον ὑπερμενέϊ Κρονίωνι,<br>κίκλησκεν δὲ γέροντας ἀριστῆας Παναχαιῶν,<br>Νέστορα μὲν πρώτιστα καὶ Ἰδομενῆα ἄνακτα,<br>αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ' Αἴαντε δύω καὶ Τυδέος υἱόν,<br>ἕκτον δ' αὖτ' Ὀδυσῆα Διὶ μῆτιν ἀτάλαντον.<br>αὐτόματος δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος:<br>ᾔδεε γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀδελφεὸν ὡς ἐπονεῖτο.<br>βοῦν δὲ περιστήσαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας ἀνέλοντο:<br>τοῖσιν δ' εὐχόμενος μετέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων:<br>Ζεῦ κύδιστε μέγιστε κελαινεφὲς αἰθέρι ναίων<br>μὴ πρὶν ἐπ' ἠέλιον δῦναι καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἐλθεῖν<br>πρίν με κατὰ πρηνὲς βαλέειν Πριάμοιο μέλαθρον<br>αἰθαλόεν, πρῆσαι δὲ πυρὸς δηί̈οιο θύρετρα,<br>Ἑκτόρεον δὲ χιτῶνα περὶ στήθεσσι δαί̈ξαι<br>χαλκῷ ῥωγαλέον: πολέες δ' ἀμφ' αὐτὸν ἑταῖροι<br>πρηνέες ἐν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο γαῖαν.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer. He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon," said he, "let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among the host, that we may begin fighting at once." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ', οὐδ' ἄρα πώ οἱ ἐπεκραίαινε Κρονίων,<br>ἀλλ' ὅ γε δέκτο μὲν ἱρά, πόνον δ' ἀμέγαρτον ὄφελλεν.<br>αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ' εὔξαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας προβάλοντο,<br>αὐέρυσαν μὲν πρῶτα καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν,<br>μηρούς τ' ἐξέταμον κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν<br>δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπ' αὐτῶν δ' ὠμοθέτησαν.<br>καὶ τὰ μὲν ἂρ σχίζῃσιν ἀφύλλοισιν κατέκαιον,<br>σπλάγχνα δ' ἄρ' ἀμπείραντες ὑπείρεχον Ἡφαίστοιο.<br>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρε κάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο,<br>μίστυλλόν τ' ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφ' ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν,<br>ὤπτησάν τε περιφραδέως, ἐρύσαντό τε πάντα.<br>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα<br>δαίνυντ', οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐί̈σης.<br>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,<br>τοῖς ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ:<br>Ἀτρεί̈δη κύδιστε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγάμεμνον,<br>μηκέτι νῦν δήθ' αὖθι λεγώμεθα, μηδ' ἔτι δηρὸν<br>ἀμβαλλώμεθα ἔργον ὃ δὴ θεὸς ἐγγυαλίζει.<br>ἀλλ' ἄγε κήρυκες μὲν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων<br>λαὸν κηρύσσοντες ἀγειρόντων κατὰ νῆας,<br>ἡμεῖς δ' ἀθρόοι ὧδε κατὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν<br>ἴομεν ὄφρα κε θᾶσσον ἐγείρομεν ὀξὺν Ἄρηα.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament of heaven. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ', οὐδ' ἀπίθησεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων.<br>αὐτίκα κηρύκεσσι λιγυφθόγγοισι κέλευσε<br>κηρύσσειν πόλεμον δὲ κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιούς:<br>οἳ μὲν ἐκήρυσσον, τοὶ δ' ἠγείροντο μάλ' ὦκα.<br>οἳ δ' ἀμφ' Ἀτρεί̈ωνα διοτρεφέες βασιλῆες<br>θῦνον κρίνοντες, μετὰ δὲ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη<br>αἰγίδ' ἔχουσ' ἐρίτιμον ἀγήρων ἀθανάτην τε,<br>τῆς ἑκατὸν θύσανοι παγχρύσεοι ἠερέθονται,<br>πάντες ἐϋπλεκέες, ἑκατόμβοιος δὲ ἕκαστος:<br>σὺν τῇ παιφάσσουσα διέσσυτο λαὸν Ἀχαιῶν<br>ὀτρύνουσ' ἰέναι: ἐν δὲ σθένος ὦρσεν ἑκάστῳ<br>καρδίῃ ἄλληκτον πολεμίζειν ἠδὲ μάχεσθαι.<br>τοῖσι δ' ἄφαρ πόλεμος γλυκίων γένετ' ἠὲ νέεσθαι<br>ἐν νηυσὶ γλαφυρῇσι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.<br>ἠύ̈τε πῦρ ἀί̈δηλον ἐπιφλέγει ἄσπετον ὕλην<br>οὔρεος ἐν κορυφῇς, ἕκαθεν δέ τε φαίνεται αὐγή,<br>ὣς τῶν ἐρχομένων ἀπὸ χαλκοῦ θεσπεσίοιο<br>αἴγλη παμφανόωσα δι' αἰθέρος οὐρανὸν ἷκε.</rtc></ruby></p><p><ruby>They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen is alive with their screaming.
