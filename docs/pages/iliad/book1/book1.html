Her I will not set free. Sooner shall old age come upon her in our house, in Argos, far from her native land, as she walks to and fro before the loom and serves my bed. But go, do not anger me, that you may return the safer." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἔνθ' ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>αἰδεῖσθαί θ' ἱερῆα καὶ ἀγλαὰ δέχθαι ἄποινα:<br/>ἀλλ' οὐκ Ἀτρεί̈δῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ,<br/>ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει, κρατερὸν δ' ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε:<br/>μή σε γέρον κοίλῃσιν ἐγὼ παρὰ νηυσὶ κιχείω<br/>ἢ νῦν δηθύνοντ' ἢ ὕστερον αὖτις ἰόντα,<br/>μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμῃ σκῆπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοῖο:<br/>τὴν δ' ἐγὼ οὐ λύσω: πρίν μιν καὶ γῆρας ἔπεισιν<br/>ἡμετέρῳ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἐν Ἄργεϊ τηλόθι πάτρης<br/>ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένην καὶ ἐμὸν λέχος ἀντιόωσαν:<br/>ἀλλ' ἴθι μή μ' ἐρέθιζε σαώτερος ὥς κε νέηαι.<br/>ὣς ἔφατ', ἔδεισεν δ' ὃ γέρων καὶ ἐπείθετο μύθῳ:</rtc></ruby> <ruby>So he spoke, and the old man was seized with fear and obeyed his word. He went forth in silence along the shore of the loud-resounding sea, and earnestly then, when he had gone apart, the old man prayed to the lord Apollo, whom fair-haired Leto bore: "Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stand over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rule mightily over Tenedos, Sminthian god, if ever I roofed over a temple to your pleasing, or if ever I burned to you fat thigh-pieces of bulls and goats, fulfill this prayer for me: let the Danaans pay for my tears by your arrows." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">βῆ δ' ἀκέων παρὰ θῖνα πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης:<br/>πολλὰ δ' ἔπειτ' ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἠρᾶθ' ὃ γεραιὸς<br/>Ἀπόλλωνι ἄνακτι, τὸν ἠύ̈κομος τέκε Λητώ:<br/>κλῦθί μευ ἀργυρότοξ', ὃς Χρύσην ἀμφιβέβηκας<br/>Κίλλάν τε ζαθέην Τενέδοιό τε ἶφι ἀνάσσεις,<br/>Σμινθεῦ εἴ ποτέ τοι χαρίεντ' ἐπὶ νηὸν ἔρεψα,<br/>ἢ εἰ δή ποτέ τοι κατὰ πίονα μηρί' ἔκηα<br/>ταύρων ἠδ' αἰγῶν, τὸ δέ μοι κρήηνον ἐέλδωρ:<br/>τίσειαν Δαναοὶ ἐμὰ δάκρυα σοῖσι βέλεσσιν.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Down from the peaks of Olympus he strode, angered at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. The arrows rattled on the shoulders of the angry god as he moved, and his coming was like the night. Then he sat down apart from the ships and let fly an arrow: terrible was the twang of the silver bow. The mules he assailed first and the swift dogs, but then on the men themselves he let fly his stinging shafts, and struck; and constantly the pyres of the dead burned thick. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ' εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δ' ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,<br/>βῆ δὲ κατ' Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων χωόμενος κῆρ,<br/>τόξ' ὤμοισιν ἔχων ἀμφηρεφέα τε φαρέτρην:<br/>ἔκλαγξαν δ' ἄρ' ὀϊστοὶ ἐπ' ὤμων χωομένοιο,<br/>αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος: ὃ δ' ἤϊε νυκτὶ ἐοικώς.<br/>ἕζετ' ἔπειτ' ἀπάνευθε νεῶν, μετὰ δ' ἰὸν ἕηκε:<br/>δεινὴ δὲ κλαγγὴ γένετ' ἀργυρέοιο βιοῖο:<br/>οὐρῆας μὲν πρῶτον ἐπῴχετο καὶ κύνας ἀργούς,<br/>αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ' αὐτοῖσι βέλος ἐχεπευκὲς ἐφιεὶς<br/>βάλλ': αἰεὶ δὲ πυραὶ νεκύων καίοντο θαμειαί.<br/>ἐννῆμαρ μὲν ἀνὰ στρατὸν ᾤχετο κῆλα θεοῖο,</rtc></ruby> <ruby>For nine days the missiles of the god ranged among the host, but on the tenth Achilles called the people to assembly, for the goddess, white-armed Hera, had put it in his heart, since she pitied the Danaans, when she saw them dying. When they were assembled and gathered together, among them arose and spoke swift-footed Achilles: "Son of Atreus, now I think we shall return home, beaten back again, should we even escape death, if war and pestilence alike are to ravage the Achaeans. But come, let us ask some seer or priest, or some reader of dreams—for a dream too is from Zeus—who might say why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, whether he finds fault with a vow or a hecatomb; in hope that he may accept the savour of lambs and unblemished goats, and be willing to ward off the pestilence from us." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τῇ δεκάτῃ δ' ἀγορὴν δὲ καλέσσατο λαὸν Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>τῷ γὰρ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη:<br/>κήδετο γὰρ Δαναῶν, ὅτι ῥα θνήσκοντας ὁρᾶτο.<br/>οἳ δ' ἐπεὶ οὖν ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τε γένοντο,<br/>τοῖσι δ' ἀνιστάμενος μετέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δη νῦν ἄμμε παλιμπλαγχθέντας ὀί̈ω<br/>ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, εἴ κεν θάνατόν γε φύγοιμεν,<br/>εἰ δὴ ὁμοῦ πόλεμός τε δαμᾷ καὶ λοιμὸς Ἀχαιούς:<br/>ἀλλ' ἄγε δή τινα μάντιν ἐρείομεν ἢ ἱερῆα<br/>ἢ καὶ ὀνειροπόλον, καὶ γάρ τ' ὄναρ ἐκ Διός ἐστιν,<br/>ὅς κ' εἴποι ὅ τι τόσσον ἐχώσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,<br/>εἴτ' ἄρ' ὅ γ' εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται ἠδ' ἑκατόμβης,<br/>αἴ κέν πως ἀρνῶν κνίσης αἰγῶν τε τελείων<br/>βούλεται ἀντιάσας ἡμῖν ἀπὸ λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose Calchas son of Thestor, far the best of bird-diviners, who knew the things that were, and that were to be, and that had been before, and who had guided the ships of the Achaeans to Ilios by his own prophetic powers which Phoebus Apollo had bestowed upon him. He with good intent addressed the gathering, and spoke among them: "Achilles, dear to Zeus, you bid me declare the wrath of Apollo, the lord who strikes from afar. Therefore I will speak; but take thought and swear that you will readily defend me with word and with might of hand; for I think I shall anger a man who rules mightily over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey. For mightier is a king, when he is angry at a lesser man. Even if he swallows down his wrath for that day, yet afterwards he cherishes resentment in his heart till he brings it to fulfillment. Say then, if you will keep me safe." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἤτοι ὅ γ' ὣς εἰπὼν κατ' ἄρ' ἕζετο: τοῖσι δ' ἀνέστη<br/>Κάλχας Θεστορίδης οἰωνοπόλων ὄχ' ἄριστος,<br/>ὃς ᾔδη τά τ' ἐόντα τά τ' ἐσσόμενα πρό τ' ἐόντα,<br/>καὶ νήεσσ' ἡγήσατ' Ἀχαιῶν Ἴλιον εἴσω<br/>ἣν διὰ μαντοσύνην, τήν οἱ πόρε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων:<br/>ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν:<br/>ὦ Ἀχιλεῦ κέλεαί με Διὶ̈ φίλε μυθήσασθαι<br/>μῆνιν Ἀπόλλωνος ἑκατηβελέταο ἄνακτος:<br/>τοὶ γὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω: σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μοι ὄμοσσον<br/>ἦ μέν μοι πρόφρων ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσὶν ἀρήξειν:<br/>ἦ γὰρ ὀί̈ομαι ἄνδρα χολωσέμεν, ὃς μέγα πάντων<br/>Ἀργείων κρατέει καί οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί:<br/>κρείσσων γὰρ βασιλεὺς ὅτε χώσεται ἀνδρὶ χέρηϊ:<br/>εἴ περ γάρ τε χόλον γε καὶ αὐτῆμαρ καταπέψῃ,<br/>ἀλλά τε καὶ μετόπισθεν ἔχει κότον, ὄφρα τελέσσῃ,<br/>ἐν στήθεσσιν ἑοῖσι: σὺ δὲ φράσαι εἴ με σαώσεις.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilles: "Take heart, and speak out whatever oracle you know; for by Apollo, dear to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas, pray when you reveal oracles to the Danaans, no one, while I live and have sight on the earth, shall lay heavy hands on you beside the hollow ships, no one of the whole host of the Danaans, not even if you name Agamemnon, who now claims to be far the best of the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>θαρσήσας μάλα εἰπὲ θεοπρόπιον ὅ τι οἶσθα:<br/>οὐ μὰ γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνα Διὶ̈ φίλον, ᾧ τε σὺ Κάλχαν<br/>εὐχόμενος Δαναοῖσι θεοπροπίας ἀναφαίνεις,<br/>οὔ τις ἐμεῦ ζῶντος καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο<br/>σοὶ κοίλῃς παρὰ νηυσί βαρείας χεῖρας ἐποίσει<br/>συμπάντων Δαναῶν, οὐδ' ἢν Ἀγαμέμνονα εἴπῃς,<br/>ὃς νῦν πολλὸν ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν εὔχεται εἶναι.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then the blameless seer took heart, and spoke: "It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault, nor because of a hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured, and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom. For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them. He will not drive off from the Danaans the loathsome pestilence, until we give back to her dear father the bright-eyed maiden, unbought, unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb to Chryse. Then we might appease and persuade him." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">καὶ τότε δὴ θάρσησε καὶ ηὔδα μάντις ἀμύμων:<br/>οὔ τ' ἄρ ὅ γ' εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται οὐδ' ἑκατόμβης,<br/>ἀλλ' ἕνεκ' ἀρητῆρος ὃν ἠτίμησ' Ἀγαμέμνων,<br/>οὐδ' ἀπέλυσε θύγατρα καὶ οὐκ ἀπεδέξατ' ἄποινα,<br/>τοὔνεκ' ἄρ' ἄλγε' ἔδωκεν ἑκηβόλος ἠδ' ἔτι δώσει:<br/>οὐδ' ὅ γε πρὶν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει<br/>πρίν γ' ἀπὸ πατρὶ φίλῳ δόμεναι ἑλικώπιδα κούρην<br/>ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον, ἄγειν θ' ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην<br/>ἐς Χρύσην: τότε κέν μιν ἱλασσάμενοι πεπίθοιμεν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose the warrior, son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, deeply troubled. With rage his black heart was wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire. To Calchas first of all he spoke, and his look threatened evil: "Prophet of evil, never yet have you spoken to me a pleasant thing; ever is evil dear to your heart to prophesy, but a word of good you have never yet spoken, nor brought to pass. And now among the Danaans you claim in prophecy that for this reason the god who strikes from afar brings woes upon them, that I would not accept the glorious ransom for the girl, the daughter of Chryses, since I much prefer to keep her in my home. For certainly I prefer her to Clytemnestra, my wedded wife, since she is not inferior to her, either in form or in stature, or in mind, or in any handiwork. Yet even so will I give her back, if that is better; I would rather the people be safe than perish. But provide me with a prize of honour forthwith, lest I alone of the Argives be without one, since that would not be proper. For you all see this, that my prize goes elsewhere." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἤτοι ὅ γ' ὣς εἰπὼν κατ' ἄρ' ἕζετο: τοῖσι δ' ἀνέστη ἥρως Ἀτρεί̈δης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>ἀχνύμενος: μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι<br/>πίμπλαντ', ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐί̈κτην:<br/>Κάλχαντα πρώτιστα κάκ' ὀσσόμενος προσέειπε:<br/>μάντι κακῶν οὐ πώ ποτέ μοι τὸ κρήγυον εἶπας:<br/>αἰεί τοι τὰ κάκ' ἐστὶ φίλα φρεσὶ μαντεύεσθαι,<br/>ἐσθλὸν δ' οὔτέ τί πω εἶπας ἔπος οὔτ' ἐτέλεσσας:<br/>καὶ νῦν ἐν Δαναοῖσι θεοπροπέων ἀγορεύεις<br/>ὡς δὴ τοῦδ' ἕνεκά σφιν ἑκηβόλος ἄλγεα τεύχει,<br/>οὕνεκ' ἐγὼ κούρης Χρυσηί̈δος ἀγλά' ἄποινα<br/>οὐκ ἔθελον δέξασθαι, ἐπεὶ πολὺ βούλομαι αὐτὴν<br/>οἴκοι ἔχειν: καὶ γάρ ῥα Κλυταιμνήστρης προβέβουλα<br/>κουριδίης ἀλόχου, ἐπεὶ οὔ ἑθέν ἐστι χερείων,<br/>οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν, οὔτ' ἂρ φρένας οὔτέ τι ἔργα.<br/>ἀλλὰ καὶ ὧς ἐθέλω δόμεναι πάλιν εἰ τό γ' ἄμεινον:<br/>βούλομ' ἐγὼ λαὸν σῶν ἔμμεναι ἢ ἀπολέσθαι:<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ γέρας αὐτίχ' ἑτοιμάσατ' ὄφρα μὴ οἶος<br/>Ἀργείων ἀγέραστος ἔω, ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ ἔοικε:<br/>λεύσσετε γὰρ τό γε πάντες ὅ μοι γέρας ἔρχεται ἄλλῃ.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to him spoke swift-footed brilliant Achilles: "Most glorious son of Atreus, most covetous of all, how shall the great-hearted Achaeans give you a prize? We know nothing of a hoard of wealth in common store, but whatever we took by pillage from the cities has been apportioned, and it is not seemly to gather these things back from the army. But give back the girl to the god, and we Achaeans will recompense you three and fourfold, if ever Zeus grants us to sack the well-walled city of Troy." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἠμείβετ' ἔπειτα ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δη κύδιστε φιλοκτεανώτατε πάντων,<br/>πῶς γάρ τοι δώσουσι γέρας μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοί;<br/>οὐδέ τί που ἴδμεν ξυνήϊα κείμενα πολλά:<br/>ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν πολίων ἐξεπράθομεν, τὰ δέδασται,<br/>λαοὺς δ' οὐκ ἐπέοικε παλίλλογα ταῦτ' ἐπαγείρειν.<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν τήνδε θεῷ πρόες: αὐτὰρ Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>τριπλῇ τετραπλῇ τ' ἀποτείσομεν, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς<br/>δῷσι πόλιν Τροίην εὐτείχεον ἐξαλαπάξαι.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon: "Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit; for you will not get by me nor persuade me. Are you willing, so that your yourself may keep your prize, for me to sit here idly in want, while you order me to give her back? No, if the great-hearted Achaeans give me a prize, suiting it to my mind, so that it will be worth just as much—but if they do not, I myself will come and take your prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus I will seize and bear away. Angry will he be, to whomever I come. But these things we will consider hereafter. Let us now drag a black ship to the shining sea, and quickly gather suitable rowers into it, and place on board a hecatomb, and embark on it the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses herself. Let one prudent man be its commander, either Aias, or Idomeneus, or brilliant Odysseus, or you, son of Peleus, of all men most extreme, so that on our behalf you may propitiate the god who strikes from afar by offering sacrifice." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων:<br/>μὴ δ' οὕτως ἀγαθός περ ἐὼν θεοείκελ' Ἀχιλλεῦ<br/>κλέπτε νόῳ, ἐπεὶ οὐ παρελεύσεαι οὐδέ με πείσεις.<br/>ἦ ἐθέλεις ὄφρ' αὐτὸς ἔχῃς γέρας, αὐτὰρ ἔμ' αὔτως<br/>ἧσθαι δευόμενον, κέλεαι δέ με τήνδ' ἀποδοῦναι;<br/>ἀλλ' εἰ μὲν δώσουσι γέρας μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>ἄρσαντες κατὰ θυμὸν ὅπως ἀντάξιον ἔσται:<br/>εἰ δέ κε μὴ δώωσιν ἐγὼ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἕλωμαι<br/>ἢ τεὸν ἢ Αἴαντος ἰὼν γέρας, ἢ Ὀδυσῆος<br/>ἄξω ἑλών: ὃ δέ κεν κεχολώσεται ὅν κεν ἵκωμαι.<br/>ἀλλ' ἤτοι μὲν ταῦτα μεταφρασόμεσθα καὶ αὖτις,<br/>νῦν δ' ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν,<br/>ἐν δ' ἐρέτας ἐπιτηδὲς ἀγείρομεν, ἐς δ' ἑκατόμβην<br/>θείομεν, ἂν δ' αὐτὴν Χρυσηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον<br/>βήσομεν: εἷς δέ τις ἀρχὸς ἀνὴρ βουληφόρος ἔστω,<br/>ἢ Αἴας ἢ Ἰδομενεὺς ἢ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς<br/>ἠὲ σὺ Πηλεί̈δη πάντων ἐκπαγλότατ' ἀνδρῶν,<br/>ὄφρ' ἥμιν ἑκάεργον ἱλάσσεαι ἱερὰ ῥέξας.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Glaring from beneath his brows spoke to him swift-footed Achilles: "Ah me, clothed in shamelessness, thinking of profit, how shall any man of the Achaeans obey your words with a ready heart either to go on a journey or to fight against men with force? It was not on account of the Trojan spearmen that I came here to fight, since they have done no wrong to me. Never have they driven off my cattle or my horses, nor ever in deep-soiled Phthia, nurse of men, did they lay waste the harvest, for many things lie between us—shadowy mountains and sounding sea. But you, shameless one, we followed, so that you might rejoice, seeking to win recompense for Menelaus and for yourself, dog-face, from the Trojans. This you disregard, and take no heed of. And now you threaten that you will yourself take my prize away from me, for which I toiled so much, which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me. Never have I prize like yours, whenever the Achaeans sack a well-inhabited citadel of the Trojans. The brunt of furious battle do my hands undertake, but if ever an apportionment comes, your prize is far greater, while small but dear is the reward I take to my ships, when I have worn myself out in the fighting. Now I will go back to Phthia, since it is far better to return home with my beaked ships, nor do I intend while I am here dishonoured to pile up riches and wealth for you." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἄρ' ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>ὤ μοι ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένε κερδαλεόφρον<br/>πῶς τίς τοι πρόφρων ἔπεσιν πείθηται Ἀχαιῶν<br/>ἢ ὁδὸν ἐλθέμεναι ἢ ἀνδράσιν ἶφι μάχεσθαι;<br/>οὐ γὰρ ἐγὼ Τρώων ἕνεκ' ἤλυθον αἰχμητάων<br/>δεῦρο μαχησόμενος, ἐπεὶ οὔ τί μοι αἴτιοί εἰσιν:<br/>οὐ γὰρ πώποτ' ἐμὰς βοῦς ἤλασαν οὐδὲ μὲν ἵππους,<br/>οὐδέ ποτ' ἐν Φθίῃ ἐριβώλακι βωτιανείρῃ<br/>καρπὸν ἐδηλήσαντ', ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα πολλὰ μεταξὺ<br/>οὔρεά τε σκιόεντα θάλασσά τε ἠχήεσσα:<br/>ἀλλὰ σοὶ ὦ μέγ' ἀναιδὲς ἅμ' ἑσπόμεθ' ὄφρα σὺ χαίρῃς,<br/>τιμὴν ἀρνύμενοι Μενελάῳ σοί τε κυνῶπα<br/>πρὸς Τρώων: τῶν οὔ τι μετατρέπῃ οὐδ' ἀλεγίζεις:<br/>καὶ δή μοι γέρας αὐτὸς ἀφαιρήσεσθαι ἀπειλεῖς,<br/>ᾧ ἔπι πολλὰ μόγησα, δόσαν δέ μοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν.<br/>οὐ μὲν σοί ποτε ἶσον ἔχω γέρας ὁππότ' Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>Τρώων ἐκπέρσωσ' εὖ ναιόμενον πτολίεθρον:<br/>ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πλεῖον πολυάϊκος πολέμοιο<br/>χεῖρες ἐμαὶ διέπουσ': ἀτὰρ ἤν ποτε δασμὸς ἵκηται,<br/>σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον, ἐγὼ δ' ὀλίγον τε φίλον τε<br/>ἔρχομ' ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆας, ἐπεί κε κάμω πολεμίζων.<br/>νῦν δ' εἶμι Φθίην δ', ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστιν<br/>οἴκαδ' ἴμεν σὺν νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν, οὐδέ σ' ὀί̈ω<br/>ἐνθάδ' ἄτιμος ἐὼν ἄφενος καὶ πλοῦτον ἀφύξειν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him: "Flee then, if your heart urges you; I do not beg you to remain for my sake.

But I will threaten you thus: as Phoebus Apollo takes from me the daughter of Chryses, her with my ship and my companions I will send back, but I will myself come to your tent and take the fair-cheeked Briseis, your prize, so that you will understand how much mightier I am than you, and another may shrink from declaring himself my equal and likening himself to me to my face." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἠμείβετ' ἔπειτα ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων:<br/>φεῦγε μάλ' εἴ τοι θυμὸς ἐπέσσυται, οὐδέ σ' ἔγωγε<br/>λίσσομαι εἵνεκ' ἐμεῖο μένειν: πάρ' ἔμοιγε καὶ ἄλλοι<br/>οἵ κέ με τιμήσουσι, μάλιστα δὲ μητίετα Ζεύς.<br/>ἔχθιστος δέ μοί ἐσσι διοτρεφέων βασιλήων:<br/>αἰεὶ γάρ τοι ἔρις τε φίλη πόλεμοί τε μάχαι τε:<br/>εἰ μάλα καρτερός ἐσσι, θεός που σοὶ τό γ' ἔδωκεν:<br/>οἴκαδ' ἰὼν σὺν νηυσί τε σῇς καὶ σοῖς ἑτάροισι<br/>Μυρμιδόνεσσιν ἄνασσε, σέθεν δ' ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀλεγίζω,<br/>οὐδ' ὄθομαι κοτέοντος: ἀπειλήσω δέ τοι ὧδε:<br/>ὡς ἔμ' ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηί̈δα Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,<br/>τὴν μὲν ἐγὼ σὺν νηί̈ τ' ἐμῇ καὶ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισι<br/>πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ' ἄγω Βρισηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον<br/>αὐτὸς ἰὼν κλισίην δὲ τὸ σὸν γέρας ὄφρ' ἐὺ̈ εἰδῇς<br/>ὅσσον φέρτερός εἰμι σέθεν, στυγέῃ δὲ καὶ ἄλλος<br/>ἶσον ἐμοὶ φάσθαι καὶ ὁμοιωθήμεναι ἄντην.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So he spoke. Grief came upon the son of Peleus, and within his shaggy breast his heart was divided, whether he should draw his sharp sword from beside his thigh, and break up the assembly, and slay the son of Atreus, or stay his anger and curb his spirit. While he pondered this in mind and heart, and was drawing from its sheath his great sword, Athene came from heaven. The white-armed goddess Hera had sent her forth, for in her heart she loved and cared for both men alike. She stood behind him, and seized the son of Peleus by his fair hair, appearing to him alone. No one of the others saw her. Achilles was seized with wonder, and turned around, and immediately recognized Pallas Athene. Terribly her eyes shone. Then he addressed her with winged words, and said: "Why now, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, have you come? Is it so that you might see the arrogance of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? One thing I will tell you, and I think this will be brought to pass: through his own excessive pride shall he presently lose his life." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο: Πηλεί̈ωνι δ' ἄχος γένετ', ἐν δέ οἱ ἦτορ<br/>στήθεσσιν λασίοισι διάνδιχα μερμήριξεν,<br/>ἢ ὅ γε φάσγανον ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ<br/>τοὺς μὲν ἀναστήσειεν, ὃ δ' Ἀτρεί̈δην ἐναρίζοι,<br/>ἦε χόλον παύσειεν ἐρητύσειέ τε θυμόν.<br/>ἧος ὃ ταῦθ' ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν,<br/>ἕλκετο δ' ἐκ κολεοῖο μέγα ξίφος, ἦλθε δ' Ἀθήνη<br/>οὐρανόθεν: πρὸ γὰρ ἧκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη<br/>ἄμφω ὁμῶς θυμῷ φιλέουσά τε κηδομένη τε:<br/>στῆ δ' ὄπιθεν, ξανθῆς δὲ κόμης ἕλε Πηλεί̈ωνα<br/>οἴῳ φαινομένη: τῶν δ' ἄλλων οὔ τις ὁρᾶτο:<br/>θάμβησεν δ' Ἀχιλεύς, μετὰ δ' ἐτράπετ', αὐτίκα δ' ἔγνω<br/>Παλλάδ' Ἀθηναίην: δεινὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε φάανθεν:<br/>καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:<br/>τίπτ' αὖτ' αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος εἰλήλουθας;<br/>ἦ ἵνα ὕβριν ἴδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεί̈δαο;<br/>ἀλλ' ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τελέεσθαι ὀί̈ω:<br/>ᾗς ὑπεροπλίῃσι τάχ' ἄν ποτε θυμὸν ὀλέσσῃ.<br/>τὸν δ' αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:</rtc></ruby> <ruby>Him then the goddess, bright-eyed Athene, answered: "I have come from heaven to stay your anger, if you will obey, The goddess white-armed Hera sent me forth, for in her heart she loves and cares for both of you.

That seems to you even as death. Indeed it is far better throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans to deprive of his prize whoever speaks contrary to you. People-devouring king, since you rule over nobodies; else, son of Atreus, this would be your last piece of insolence. But I will speak out to you, and will swear thereto a mighty oath: by this staff, that shall never more put forth leaves or shoots since first it left its stump among the mountains, nor shall it again grow green, for the bronze has stripped it on all sides of leaves and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans carry it in their hands when they act as judges, those who guard the ordinances that come from Zeus; and this shall be for you a mighty oath. Surely some day a longing for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans one and all, and on that day you will not be able to help them at all, for all your grief, when many shall fall dying before man-slaying Hector. But you will gnaw the heart within you, in anger that you did no honour to the best of the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Πηλεί̈δης δ' ἐξαῦτις ἀταρτηροῖς ἐπέεσσιν<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δην προσέειπε, καὶ οὔ πω λῆγε χόλοιο:<br/>οἰνοβαρές, κυνὸς ὄμματ' ἔχων, κραδίην δ' ἐλάφοιο,<br/>οὔτέ ποτ' ἐς πόλεμον ἅμα λαῷ θωρηχθῆναι<br/>οὔτε λόχον δ' ἰέναι σὺν ἀριστήεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν<br/>τέτληκας θυμῷ: τὸ δέ τοι κὴρ εἴδεται εἶναι.<br/>ἦ πολὺ λώϊόν ἐστι κατὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν<br/>δῶρ' ἀποαιρεῖσθαι ὅς τις σέθεν ἀντίον εἴπῃ:<br/>δημοβόρος βασιλεὺς ἐπεὶ οὐτιδανοῖσιν ἀνάσσεις:<br/>ἦ γὰρ ἂν Ἀτρεί̈δη νῦν ὕστατα λωβήσαιο.<br/>ἀλλ' ἔκ τοι ἐρέω καὶ ἐπὶ μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμοῦμαι:<br/>ναὶ μὰ τόδε σκῆπτρον, τὸ μὲν οὔ ποτε φύλλα καὶ ὄζους<br/>φύσει, ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτα τομὴν ἐν ὄρεσσι λέλοιπεν,<br/>οὐδ' ἀναθηλήσει: περὶ γάρ ῥά ἑ χαλκὸς ἔλεψε<br/>φύλλά τε καὶ φλοιόν: νῦν αὖτέ μιν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν<br/>ἐν παλάμῃς φορέουσι δικασπόλοι, οἵ τε θέμιστας<br/>πρὸς Διὸς εἰρύαται: ὃ δέ τοι μέγας ἔσσεται ὅρκος:<br/>ἦ ποτ' Ἀχιλλῆος ποθὴ ἵξεται υἷας Ἀχαιῶν<br/>σύμπαντας: τότε δ' οὔ τι δυνήσεαι ἀχνύμενός περ<br/>χραισμεῖν, εὖτ' ἂν πολλοὶ ὑφ' Ἕκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο<br/>θνήσκοντες πίπτωσι: σὺ δ' ἔνδοθι θυμὸν ἀμύξεις<br/>χωόμενος ὅ τ' ἄριστον Ἀχαιῶν οὐδὲν ἔτισας.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So spoke the son of Peleus, and down to the earth he dashed the staff studded with golden nails, and himself sat down, while over against him the son of Atreus continued to vent his wrath. Then among them arose Nestor, sweet of speech, the clear-voiced orator of the Pylians, from whose tongue flowed speech sweeter than honey. Two generations of mortal men had passed away in his lifetime, who had been born and reared with him before in sacred Pylos, and he was king among the third. He with good intent addressed the gathering and spoke among them: "Comrades, great grief has come upon the land of Achaea. Truly would Priam and the sons of Priam rejoice, and the rest of the Trojans would be most glad at heart, were they to hear all this of you two quarrelling, you who are chief among the Danaans in counsel and chief in war. Listen to me, for you are both younger than I. In earlier times I moved among men more warlike than you, and never did they despise me. Such warriors have I never since seen, nor shall I see, as Peirithous was and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus, son of Aegeus, a man like the immortals. Mightiest were these of men reared upon the earth; mightiest were they, and with the mightiest they fought, the mountain-dwelling centaurs, and they destroyed them terribly. With these men I had fellowship, when I came from Pylos, from a distant land far away; for they themselves called me. And I fought on my own; with those men could no one fight of the mortals now upon the earth. Yes, and they listened to my counsel, and obeyed my words. So also should you obey, since to obey is better. Neither do you, mighty though you are, take away the girl, but let her be, as the sons of the Achaeans first gave her to him as a prize; nor do you, son of Peleus, be minded to strive with a king, might against might, for it is no common honour that is the portion of a sceptre-holding king, to whom Zeus gives glory. If you are a stronger fighter, and a goddess mother bore you, yet he is the mightier, since he is king over more. Son of Atreus, check your rage. Indeed, I beg you to let go your anger against Achilles, who is for all the Achaeans a mighty bulwark in evil war." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο Πηλεί̈δης, ποτὶ δὲ σκῆπτρον βάλε γαίῃ<br/>χρυσείοις ἥλοισι πεπαρμένον, ἕζετο δ' αὐτός:<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δης δ' ἑτέρωθεν ἐμήνιε: τοῖσι δὲ Νέστωρ<br/>ἡδυεπὴς ἀνόρουσε λιγὺς Πυλίων ἀγορητής,<br/>τοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ γλώσσης μέλιτος γλυκίων ῥέεν αὐδή:<br/>τῷ δ' ἤδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων<br/>ἐφθίαθ', οἵ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα τράφεν ἠδ' ἐγένοντο<br/>ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ, μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν:<br/>ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν:<br/>ὦ πόποι ἦ μέγα πένθος Ἀχαιί̈δα γαῖαν ἱκάνει:<br/>ἦ κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες<br/>ἄλλοι τε Τρῶες μέγα κεν κεχαροίατο θυμῷ<br/>εἰ σφῶϊν τάδε πάντα πυθοίατο μαρναμένοιϊν,<br/>οἳ περὶ μὲν βουλὴν Δαναῶν, περὶ δ' ἐστὲ μάχεσθαι.<br/>ἀλλὰ πίθεσθ': ἄμφω δὲ νεωτέρω ἐστὸν ἐμεῖο:<br/>ἤδη γάρ ποτ' ἐγὼ καὶ ἀρείοσιν ἠέ περ ὑμῖν<br/>ἀνδράσιν ὡμίλησα, καὶ οὔ ποτέ μ' οἵ γ' ἀθέριζον.<br/>οὐ γάρ πω τοίους ἴδον ἀνέρας οὐδὲ ἴδωμαι,<br/>οἷον Πειρίθοόν τε Δρύαντά τε ποιμένα λαῶν<br/>Καινέα τ' Ἐξάδιόν τε καὶ ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον<br/>Θησέα τ' Αἰγεί̈δην, ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν:<br/>κάρτιστοι δὴ κεῖνοι ἐπιχθονίων τράφεν ἀνδρῶν:<br/>κάρτιστοι μὲν ἔσαν καὶ καρτίστοις ἐμάχοντο<br/>φηρσὶν ὀρεσκῴοισι καὶ ἐκπάγλως ἀπόλεσσαν.<br/>καὶ μὲν τοῖσιν ἐγὼ μεθομίλεον ἐκ Πύλου ἐλθὼν<br/>τηλόθεν ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης: καλέσαντο γὰρ αὐτοί:<br/>καὶ μαχόμην κατ' ἔμ' αὐτὸν ἐγώ: κείνοισι δ' ἂν οὔ τις<br/>τῶν οἳ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπιχθόνιοι μαχέοιτο:<br/>καὶ μέν μευ βουλέων ξύνιεν πείθοντό τε μύθῳ:<br/>ἀλλὰ πίθεσθε καὶ ὔμμες, ἐπεὶ πείθεσθαι ἄμεινον:<br/>μήτε σὺ τόνδ' ἀγαθός περ ἐὼν ἀποαίρεο κούρην,<br/>ἀλλ' ἔα ὥς οἱ πρῶτα δόσαν γέρας υἷες Ἀχαιῶν:<br/>μήτε σὺ Πηλείδη ἔθελ' ἐριζέμεναι βασιλῆϊ<br/>ἀντιβίην, ἐπεὶ οὔ ποθ' ὁμοίης ἔμμορε τιμῆς<br/>σκηπτοῦχος βασιλεύς, ᾧ τε Ζεὺς κῦδος ἔδωκεν.<br/>εἰ δὲ σὺ καρτερός ἐσσι θεὰ δέ σε γείνατο μήτηρ,<br/>ἀλλ' ὅ γε φέρτερός ἐστιν ἐπεὶ πλεόνεσσιν ἀνάσσει.<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δη σὺ δὲ παῦε τεὸν μένος: αὐτὰρ ἔγωγε<br/>λίσσομ' Ἀχιλλῆϊ μεθέμεν χόλον, ὃς μέγα πᾶσιν<br/>ἕρκος Ἀχαιοῖσιν πέλεται πολέμοιο κακοῖο.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon: "All these things, old man, to be sure, you have spoken as is right. But this man wishes to be above all others; over all he wishes to rule and over all to be king, and to all to give orders; in this, I think, there is someone who will not obey.

And another thing I will tell you, and take it to heart: with my hands I will not fight for the girl's sake either with you nor with any other, since you are taking away what you have given. But of all else that is mine by my swift black ship, nothing will you take or carry away against my will.

The son of Peleus went his way to his huts and his balanced ships together with the son of Menoetius, and with his men; but the son of Atreus launched a swift ship on the sea, and chose for it twenty rowers, and drove on board a hecatomb for the god, and brought the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses and set her in the ship; and Odysseus of many wiles went on board to take command. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς τώ γ' ἀντιβίοισι μαχεσσαμένω ἐπέεσσιν<br/>ἀνστήτην, λῦσαν δ' ἀγορὴν παρὰ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν:<br/>Πηλεί̈δης μὲν ἐπὶ κλισίας καὶ νῆας ἐί̈σας<br/>ἤϊε σύν τε Μενοιτιάδῃ καὶ οἷς ἑτάροισιν:<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δης δ' ἄρα νῆα θοὴν ἅλα δὲ προέρυσσεν,<br/>ἐν δ' ἐρέτας ἔκρινεν ἐείκοσιν, ἐς δ' ἑκατόμβην<br/>βῆσε θεῷ, ἀνὰ δὲ Χρυσηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον<br/>εἷσεν ἄγων: ἐν δ' ἀρχὸς ἔβη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So these embarked and sailed over the watery ways; but the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves. And they purified themselves, and cast the defilement into the sea, and offered to Apollo perfect hecatombs of bulls and goats by the shore of the barren sea; and the savour thereof went up to heaven, eddying amid the smoke. Thus were they busied throughout the camp; but Agamemnon did not cease from the strife with which he had first threatened Achilles, but called to Talthybius and Eurybates, who were his heralds and ready squires: "Go to the hut of Achilles, Peleus' son, and take by the hand the fair-cheeked Briseis, and lead her hither; and if he give her not, I will myself go with a larger company and take her; that will be even the worse for him." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">οἳ μὲν ἔπειτ' ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα,<br/>λαοὺς δ' Ἀτρεί̈δης ἀπολυμαίνεσθαι ἄνωγεν:<br/>οἳ δ' ἀπελυμαίνοντο καὶ εἰς ἅλα λύματα βάλλον,<br/>ἕρδον δ' Ἀπόλλωνι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας<br/>ταύρων ἠδ' αἰγῶν παρὰ θῖν' ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο: κνίση δ' οὐρανὸν ἷκεν ἑλισσομένη περὶ καπνῷ.<br/><br/>ὣς οἳ μὲν τὰ πένοντο κατὰ στρατόν: οὐδ' Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>λῆγ' ἔριδος τὴν πρῶτον ἐπηπείλησ' Ἀχιλῆϊ,<br/>ἀλλ' ὅ γε Ταλθύβιόν τε καὶ Εὐρυβάτην προσέειπε,<br/>τώ οἱ ἔσαν κήρυκε καὶ ὀτρηρὼ θεράποντε:<br/>ἔρχεσθον κλισίην Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος:<br/>χειρὸς ἑλόντ' ἀγέμεν Βρισηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον:<br/>εἰ δέ κε μὴ δώῃσιν ἐγὼ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἕλωμαι<br/>ἐλθὼν σὺν πλεόνεσσι: τό οἱ καὶ ῥίγιον ἔσται.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So saying he sent them forth, and laid upon them a stern command. Unwilling went the two along the shore of the barren sea, and came to the tents and the ships of the Myrmidons. Him they found sitting beside his tent and his black ship; and Achilles was not glad at sight of them. The two, seized with dread and in awe of the king, stood, and spoke no word to him, nor made question; but he knew in his heart, and spoke: "Hail, heralds, messengers of Zeus and men, draw near. It is not you who are guilty in my sight, but Agamemnon, who sent you forth for the sake of the girl, Briseis. But come, Patroclus, sprung from Zeus, bring forth the girl, and give her to them to lead away. However, let these two themselves be witnesses before the blessed gods and mortal men, and before him, that ruthless king, if hereafter there shall be need of me to ward off shameful ruin from the host. Truly he rages with baneful mind, and knows not at all to look both before and after, that his Achaeans might wage war in safety beside their ships." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς εἰπὼν προί̈ει, κρατερὸν δ' ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε:<br/>τὼ δ' ἀέκοντε βάτην παρὰ θῖν' ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο,<br/>Μυρμιδόνων δ' ἐπί τε κλισίας καὶ νῆας ἱκέσθην,<br/>τὸν δ' εὗρον παρά τε κλισίῃ καὶ νηὶ̈ μελαίνῃ<br/>ἥμενον: οὐδ' ἄρα τώ γε ἰδὼν γήθησεν Ἀχιλλεύς.<br/>τὼ μὲν ταρβήσαντε καὶ αἰδομένω βασιλῆα<br/>στήτην, οὐδέ τί μιν προσεφώνεον οὐδ' ἐρέοντο:<br/>αὐτὰρ ὃ ἔγνω ᾗσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ φώνησέν τε:<br/>χαίρετε κήρυκες Διὸς ἄγγελοι ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν,<br/>ἆσσον ἴτ': οὔ τί μοι ὔμμες ἐπαίτιοι ἀλλ' Ἀγαμέμνων,<br/>ὃ σφῶϊ προί̈ει Βρισηί̈δος εἵνεκα κούρης.<br/>ἀλλ' ἄγε διογενὲς Πατρόκλεες ἔξαγε κούρην<br/>καί σφωϊν δὸς ἄγειν: τὼ δ' αὐτὼ μάρτυροι ἔστων<br/>πρός τε θεῶν μακάρων πρός τε θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων<br/>καὶ πρὸς τοῦ βασιλῆος ἀπηνέος εἴ ποτε δ' αὖτε<br/>χρειὼ ἐμεῖο γένηται ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι<br/>τοῖς ἄλλοις: ἦ γὰρ ὅ γ' ὀλοιῇσι φρεσὶ θύει,<br/>οὐδέ τι οἶδε νοῆσαι ἅμα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω,<br/>ὅππως οἱ παρὰ νηυσὶ σόοι μαχέοιντο Ἀχαιοί.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So he spoke, and Patroclus obeyed his dear comrade, and led forth from the hut the fair-cheeked Briseis, and gave her to them to lead away. So the two went back beside the ships of the Achaeans, and with them, all unwilling, went the woman. But Achilles burst into tears, and withdrew apart from his comrades, and sat down on the shore of the grey sea, looking forth over the wine-dark deep. Earnestly he prayed to his dear mother with hands outstretched: "Mother, since you bore me, though to so brief a span of life, honour surely ought the Olympian to have given into my hands, Zeus who thunders on high; but now he has honoured me not a bit. Truly the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon has dishonoured me: for he has taken and keeps my prize through his own arrogant act. So he spoke, weeping, and his lady mother heard him, as she sat in the depths of the sea beside the old man, her father. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, Πάτροκλος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθεθ' ἑταίρῳ,<br/>ἐκ δ' ἄγαγε κλισίης Βρισηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον,<br/>δῶκε δ' ἄγειν: τὼ δ' αὖτις ἴτην παρὰ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν:<br/>ἣ δ' ἀέκουσ' ἅμα τοῖσι γυνὴ κίεν: αὐτὰρ Ἀχιλλεὺς<br/>δακρύσας ἑτάρων ἄφαρ ἕζετο νόσφι λιασθείς,<br/>θῖν' ἔφ' ἁλὸς πολιῆς, ὁρόων ἐπ' ἀπείρονα πόντον:<br/>πολλὰ δὲ μητρὶ φίλῃ ἠρήσατο χεῖρας ὀρεγνύς:<br/>μῆτερ ἐπεί μ' ἔτεκές γε μινυνθάδιόν περ ἐόντα,<br/>τιμήν πέρ μοι ὄφελλεν Ὀλύμπιος ἐγγυαλίξαι<br/>Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης: νῦν δ' οὐδέ με τυτθὸν ἔτισεν:<br/>ἦ γάρ μ' Ἀτρεί̈δης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>ἠτίμησεν: ἑλὼν γὰρ ἔχει γέρας αὐτὸς ἀπούρας.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>And speedily she came forth from the grey sea like a mist, and sat down before him, as he wept, and she stroked him with her hand, and spoke to him, and called him by name: "My child, why do you weep? What sorrow has come upon your heart? Speak out; hide it not in your mind, that we both may know." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο δάκρυ χέων, τοῦ δ' ἔκλυε πότνια μήτηρ<br/>ἡμένη ἐν βένθεσσιν ἁλὸς παρὰ πατρὶ γέροντι:<br/>καρπαλίμως δ' ἀνέδυ πολιῆς ἁλὸς ἠύ̈τ' ὀμίχλη,<br/>καί ῥα πάροιθ' αὐτοῖο καθέζετο δάκρυ χέοντος,<br/>χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τ' ἔφατ' ἔκ τ' ὀνόμαζε:<br/>τέκνον τί κλαίεις; τί δέ σε φρένας ἵκετο πένθος;<br/>ἐξαύδα, μὴ κεῦθε νόῳ, ἵνα εἴδομεν ἄμφω.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then with heavy moaning spoke swift-footed Achilles to her: "You know. Why then should I tell the tale to you who knows all? We went forth to Thebe, the sacred city of Eetion, and laid it waste, and brought here all the spoil. This the sons of the Achaeans divided properly among themselves, but for the son of Atreus they chose out the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses. However, Chryses, priest of Apollo, who strikes from afar, came to the swift ships of the bronze-clad Achaeans, to free his daughter, bearing ransom past counting, and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar, on a staff of gold, and he implored all the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, marshallers of the people. Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom; yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command. So the old man went back again in anger; and Apollo heard his prayer, for he was very dear to him, and sent against the Argives an evil shaft. Then the people began to die thick and fast, and the shafts of the god ranged everywhere throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans. But to us the prophet with sure knowledge declared the oracles of the god who strikes from afar." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δὲ βαρὺ στενάχων προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>οἶσθα: τί ἤ τοι ταῦτα ἰδυίῃ πάντ' ἀγορεύω;<br/>ᾠχόμεθ' ἐς Θήβην ἱερὴν πόλιν Ἠετίωνος,<br/>τὴν δὲ διεπράθομέν τε καὶ ἤγομεν ἐνθάδε πάντα:<br/>καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ δάσσαντο μετὰ σφίσιν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν,<br/>ἐκ δ' ἕλον Ἀτρεί̈δῃ Χρυσηί̈δα καλλιπάρῃον.<br/>Χρύσης δ' αὖθ' ἱερεὺς ἑκατηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος<br/>ἦλθε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων<br/>λυσόμενός τε θύγατρα φέρων τ' ἀπερείσι' ἄποινα,<br/>στέμματ' ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος<br/>χρυσέῳ ἀνὰ σκήπτρῳ, καὶ λίσσετο πάντας Ἀχαιούς,<br/>Ἀτρεί̈δα δὲ μάλιστα δύω κοσμήτορε λαῶν.<br/>ἔνθ' ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>αἰδεῖσθαί θ' ἱερῆα καὶ ἀγλαὰ δέχθαι ἄποινα:<br/>ἀλλ' οὐκ Ἀτρεί̈δῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ,<br/>ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει, κρατερὸν δ' ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε:<br/>χωόμενος δ' ὁ γέρων πάλιν ᾤχετο: τοῖο δ' Ἀπόλλων<br/>εὐξαμένου ἤκουσεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα οἱ φίλος ἦεν,<br/>ἧκε δ' ἐπ' Ἀργείοισι κακὸν βέλος: οἳ δέ νυ λαοὶ<br/>θνῇσκον ἐπασσύτεροι, τὰ δ' ἐπῴχετο κῆλα θεοῖο<br/>πάντῃ ἀνὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν: ἄμμι δὲ μάντις<br/>εὖ εἰδὼς ἀγόρευε θεοπροπίας ἑκάτοιο.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>"Forthwith, then, I first bade propitiate the god, but thereafter anger seized the son of Atreus, and straightway he arose and spoke a threatening word, which now has come to pass. For the quick-glancing Achaeans are taking the maiden in a swift ship to Chryse, and are bearing gifts to the god; while the other woman the heralds have just now taken from my tent and led away, the daughter of Briseus, whom the sons of the Achaeans gave me. But, you, if you are able, guard your own son; go to Olympus and make prayer to Zeus, if ever you have gladdened his heart by word or deed. For often I have heard you glorying in the halls of my father, and declaring that you alone among the immortals warded off shameful ruin from the son of Cronos, lord of the dark clouds, on the day when the other Olympians wished to put him in bonds, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds, when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father. He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus. Bring this now to his remembrance, and sit by his side, and clasp his knees, in hope that he might perhaps wish to succour the Trojans, and for those others, the Achaeans, to pen them in among the sterns of their ships and around the sea as they are slain, so that they may all have profit of their king, and that the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon may know his blindness in that he did no honour to the best of the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">αὐτίκ' ἐγὼ πρῶτος κελόμην θεὸν ἱλάσκεσθαι:<br/>Ἀτρεί̈ωνα δ' ἔπειτα χόλος λάβεν, αἶψα δ' ἀναστὰς<br/>ἠπείλησεν μῦθον ὃ δὴ τετελεσμένος ἐστί:<br/>τὴν μὲν γὰρ σὺν νηὶ̈ θοῇ ἑλίκωπες Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>ἐς Χρύσην πέμπουσιν, ἄγουσι δὲ δῶρα ἄνακτι:<br/>τὴν δὲ νέον κλισίηθεν ἔβαν κήρυκες ἄγοντες<br/>κούρην Βρισῆος τήν μοι δόσαν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν.<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ εἰ δύνασαί γε περίσχεο παιδὸς ἑῆος:<br/>ἐλθοῦσ' Οὔλυμπον δὲ Δία λίσαι, εἴ ποτε δή τι<br/>ἢ ἔπει ὤνησας κραδίην Διὸς ἠὲ καὶ ἔργῳ.<br/>πολλάκι γάρ σεο πατρὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄκουσα<br/>εὐχομένης ὅτ' ἔφησθα κελαινεφέϊ Κρονίωνι<br/>οἴη ἐν ἀθανάτοισιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι,<br/>ὁππότε μιν ξυνδῆσαι Ὀλύμπιοι ἤθελον ἄλλοι<br/>Ἥρη τ' ἠδὲ Ποσειδάων καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη:<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ τόν γ' ἐλθοῦσα θεὰ ὑπελύσαο δεσμῶν,<br/>ὦχ' ἑκατόγχειρον καλέσασ' ἐς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον,<br/>ὃν Βριάρεων καλέουσι θεοί, ἄνδρες δέ τε πάντες<br/>Αἰγαίων', ὃ γὰρ αὖτε βίην οὗ πατρὸς ἀμείνων:<br/>ὅς ῥα παρὰ Κρονίωνι καθέζετο κύδεϊ γαίων:<br/>τὸν καὶ ὑπέδεισαν μάκαρες θεοὶ οὐδ' ἔτ' ἔδησαν.<br/>τῶν νῦν μιν μνήσασα παρέζεο καὶ λαβὲ γούνων<br/>αἴ κέν πως ἐθέλῃσιν ἐπὶ Τρώεσσιν ἀρῆξαι,<br/>τοὺς δὲ κατὰ πρύμνας τε καὶ ἀμφ' ἅλα ἔλσαι Ἀχαιοὺς<br/>κτεινομένους, ἵνα πάντες ἐπαύρωνται βασιλῆος,<br/>γνῷ δὲ καὶ Ἀτρεί̈δης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>ἣν ἄτην ὅ τ' ἄριστον Ἀχαιῶν οὐδὲν ἔτισεν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then Thetis answered him as she wept: "Ah me, my child, why did I rear you, cursed in my child-bearing? Would that it had been your lot to remain by your ships without tears and without grief, since your span of life is brief and endures no long time; but now you are doomed to a speedy death and are laden with sorrow above all men; therefore to an evil fate I bore you in our halls. Yet in order to tell this your word to Zeus who delights in the thunderbolt I will myself go to snowy Olympus, in hope that he may be persuaded. But remain by your swift, sea-faring ships, and continue your wrath against the Achaeans, and refrain utterly from battle; for Zeus went yesterday to Oceanus, to the blameless Ethiopians for a feast, and all the gods followed with him; but on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus, and then will I go to the house of Zeus with threshold of bronze, and will clasp his knees in prayer, and I think I shall win him." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἠμείβετ' ἔπειτα Θέτις κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσα:<br/>ὤ μοι τέκνον ἐμόν, τί νύ σ' ἔτρεφον αἰνὰ τεκοῦσα;<br/>αἴθ' ὄφελες παρὰ νηυσὶν ἀδάκρυτος καὶ ἀπήμων<br/>ἧσθαι, ἐπεί νύ τοι αἶσα μίνυνθά περ οὔ τι μάλα δήν:<br/>νῦν δ' ἅμα τ' ὠκύμορος καὶ ὀϊζυρὸς περὶ πάντων<br/>ἔπλεο: τώ σε κακῇ αἴσῃ τέκον ἐν μεγάροισι.<br/>τοῦτο δέ τοι ἐρέουσα ἔπος Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ<br/>εἶμ' αὐτὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον ἀγάννιφον αἴ κε πίθηται.<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν νηυσὶ παρήμενος ὠκυπόροισι<br/>μήνι' Ἀχαιοῖσιν, πολέμου δ' ἀποπαύεο πάμπαν:<br/>Ζεὺς γὰρ ἐς Ὠκεανὸν μετ' ἀμύμονας Αἰθιοπῆας<br/>χθιζὸς ἔβη κατὰ δαῖτα, θεοὶ δ' ἅμα πάντες ἕποντο:<br/>δωδεκάτῃ δέ τοι αὖτις ἐλεύσεται Οὔλυμπον δέ,<br/>καὶ τότ' ἔπειτά τοι εἶμι Διὸς ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ,<br/>καί μιν γουνάσομαι καί μιν πείσεσθαι ὀί̈ω.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>So saying, she went her way and left him where he was, angry at heart for the fair-girdled woman's sake, whom they had taken from him by force though he was unwilling; and meanwhile Odysseus came to Chryse bringing the holy hecatomb. When they had arrived within the deep harbour, they furled the sail, and stowed it in the black ship, and the mast they lowered by the forestays and brought it to the crutch with speed, and rowed her with oars to the place of anchorage. Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea. They brought forth the hecatomb for Apollo, who strikes from afar, and forth stepped also the daughter of Chryses from the sea-faring ship. Her then did Odysseus of many wiles lead to the altar, and place in the arms of her dear father, saying to him: "Chryses, Agamemnon, king of men, sent me forth to bring to you your daughter, and to offer to Phoebus a holy hecatomb on the Danaans' behalf, that therewith we may propitiate the lord, who has now brought upon the Argives woeful lamentation." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασ' ἀπεβήσετο, τὸν δὲ λίπ' αὐτοῦ<br/>χωόμενον κατὰ θυμὸν ἐϋζώνοιο γυναικὸς<br/>τήν ῥα βίῃ ἀέκοντος ἀπηύρων: αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς<br/>ἐς Χρύσην ἵκανεν ἄγων ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην.<br/>οἳ δ' ὅτε δὴ λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντὸς ἵκοντο<br/>ἱστία μὲν στείλαντο, θέσαν δ' ἐν νηὶ̈ μελαίνῃ,<br/>ἱστὸν δ' ἱστοδόκῃ πέλασαν προτόνοισιν ὑφέντες<br/>καρπαλίμως, τὴν δ' εἰς ὅρμον προέρεσσαν ἐρετμοῖς.<br/>ἐκ δ' εὐνὰς ἔβαλον, κατὰ δὲ πρυμνήσι' ἔδησαν:<br/>ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βαῖνον ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης,<br/>ἐκ δ' ἑκατόμβην βῆσαν ἑκηβόλῳ Ἀπόλλωνι:<br/>ἐκ δὲ Χρυσηὶ̈ς νηὸς βῆ ποντοπόροιο.<br/>τὴν μὲν ἔπειτ' ἐπὶ βωμὸν ἄγων πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεὺς<br/>πατρὶ φίλῳ ἐν χερσὶ τίθει καί μιν προσέειπεν:<br/>ὦ Χρύση, πρό μ' ἔπεμψεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>παῖδά τε σοὶ ἀγέμεν, Φοίβῳ θ' ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην<br/>ῥέξαι ὑπὲρ Δαναῶν ὄφρ' ἱλασόμεσθα ἄνακτα,<br/>ὃς νῦν Ἀργείοισι πολύστονα κήδε' ἐφῆκεν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So saying he placed her in his arms, and he joyfully took his dear child; but they made haste to set in array for the god the holy hecatomb around the well-built altar, and then they washed their hands and took up the barley grains. Then Chryses lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud for them: "Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stands over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rules mightily over Tenedos. As before you heard me when I prayed—to me you did honour, and mightily smote the host of the Achaeans—even so now fulfill me this my desire: ward off now from the Danaans the loathly pestilence." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χερσὶ τίθει, ὃ δὲ δέξατο χαίρων<br/>παῖδα φίλην: τοὶ δ' ὦκα θεῷ ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην<br/>ἑξείης ἔστησαν ἐύ̈δμητον περὶ βωμόν,<br/>χερνίψαντο δ' ἔπειτα καὶ οὐλοχύτας ἀνέλοντο.<br/>τοῖσιν δὲ Χρύσης μεγάλ' εὔχετο χεῖρας ἀνασχών:<br/>κλῦθί μευ ἀργυρότοξ', ὃς Χρύσην ἀμφιβέβηκας<br/>Κίλλαν τε ζαθέην Τενέδοιό τε ἶφι ἀνάσσεις:<br/>ἦ μὲν δή ποτ' ἐμεῦ πάρος ἔκλυες εὐξαμένοιο,<br/>τίμησας μὲν ἐμέ, μέγα δ' ἴψαο λαὸν Ἀχαιῶν:<br/>ἠδ' ἔτι καὶ νῦν μοι τόδ' ἐπικρήηνον ἐέλδωρ:<br/>ἤδη νῦν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἄμυνον.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Then, when they had prayed, and had sprinkled the barley grains, they first drew back the victims' heads, and cut their throats, and flayed them, and cut out the thighs and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh thereon. And the old man burned them on stakes of wood, and made libation over them of gleaming wine; and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the entrails, they cut up the rest and spitted it, and roasted it carefully, and drew all off the spits. Then, when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they feasted, nor did their hearts lack anything of the equal feast. But when they had put from them the desire for food and drink, the youths filled the bowls brim full of drink and served out to all, first pouring drops for libation into the cups. So the whole day long they sought to appease the god with song, singing the beautiful paean, the sons of the Achaeans, hymning the god who works from afar; and his heart was glad, as he heard. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ' εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δ' ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων.<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ' εὔξαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας προβάλοντο,<br/>αὐέρυσαν μὲν πρῶτα καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν,<br/>μηρούς τ' ἐξέταμον κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν<br/>δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπ' αὐτῶν δ' ὠμοθέτησαν:<br/>καῖε δ' ἐπὶ σχίζῃς ὁ γέρων, ἐπὶ δ' αἴθοπα οἶνον<br/>λεῖβε: νέοι δὲ παρ' αὐτὸν ἔχον πεμπώβολα χερσίν.<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρε κάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο,<br/>μίστυλλόν τ' ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφ' ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν,<br/>ὤπτησάν τε περιφραδέως, ἐρύσαντό τε πάντα.<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα<br/>δαίνυντ', οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐί̈σης.<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,<br/>κοῦροι μὲν κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο,<br/>νώμησαν δ' ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσιν:<br/>οἳ δὲ πανημέριοι μολπῇ θεὸν ἱλάσκοντο<br/>καλὸν ἀείδοντες παιήονα κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν<br/>μέλποντες ἑκάεργον: ὃ δὲ φρένα τέρπετ' ἀκούων.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>But when the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down to rest by the stern cables of the ship, and as soon as early rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, then they set sail for the wide camp of the Achaeans. And Apollo, who works from afar, sent them a favouring wind, and they set up the mast and spread the white sail. So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship, as she went, and she sped over the wave, accomplishing her way. But when they came to the wide camp of the Achaeans, they drew the black ship up on the shore, high upon the sands, and set in line the long props beneath, and themselves scattered among the tents and ships. But he in his wrath sat beside his swift-faring ships, the Zeus-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles. Never did he go forth to the place of gathering, where men win glory, nor ever to war, but wasted away his own heart, as he tarried where he was; and he longed for the war-cry and the battle. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦμος δ' ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε,<br/>δὴ τότε κοιμήσαντο παρὰ πρυμνήσια νηός:<br/>ἦμος δ' ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς,<br/>καὶ τότ' ἔπειτ' ἀνάγοντο μετὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν:<br/>τοῖσιν δ' ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει ἑκάεργος Ἀπόλλων:<br/>οἳ δ' ἱστὸν στήσαντ' ἀνά θ' ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν,<br/>ἐν δ' ἄνεμος πρῆσεν μέσον ἱστίον, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα<br/>στείρῃ πορφύρεον μεγάλ' ἴαχε νηὸς ἰούσης:<br/>ἣ δ' ἔθεεν κατὰ κῦμα διαπρήσσουσα κέλευθον.<br/>αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ' ἵκοντο κατὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν,<br/>νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἐπ' ἠπείροιο ἔρυσσαν<br/>ὑψοῦ ἐπὶ ψαμάθοις, ὑπὸ δ' ἕρματα μακρὰ τάνυσσαν:<br/>αὐτοὶ δ' ἐσκίδναντο κατὰ κλισίας τε νέας τε.<br/><br/>αὐτὰρ ὃ μήνιε νηυσὶ παρήμενος ὠκυπόροισι<br/>διογενὴς Πηλῆος υἱὸς πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς:<br/>οὔτέ ποτ' εἰς ἀγορὴν πωλέσκετο κυδιάνειραν<br/>οὔτέ ποτ' ἐς πόλεμον, ἀλλὰ φθινύθεσκε φίλον κῆρ<br/>αὖθι μένων, ποθέεσκε δ' ἀϋτήν τε πτόλεμόν τε.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Now when the twelfth morning thereafter had come, then into Olympus came the gods who are for ever, all in one company, and Zeus led the way. And Thetis did not forget the behest of her son, but rose up from the wave of the sea, and at early morning went up to great heaven and Olympus. There she found the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the rest upon the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus. So she sat down before him, and clasped his knees with her left hand, while with her right she touched him beneath the chin, and she spoke in prayer to king Zeus, son of Cronos: "Father Zeus, if ever amid the immortals I gave you aid by word or deed, grant me this prayer: do honour to my son, who is doomed to a speedy death beyond all other men; yet now Agamemnon, king of men, has dishonoured him, for he has taken and keeps his prize by his own arrogant act. But honour him, Olympian Zeus, lord of counsel; and give might to the Trojans, until the Achaeans do honour to my son, and magnify him with recompense." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἀλλ' ὅτε δή ῥ' ἐκ τοῖο δυωδεκάτη γένετ' ἠώς,<br/>καὶ τότε δὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον ἴσαν θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες<br/>πάντες ἅμα, Ζεὺς δ' ἦρχε: Θέτις δ' οὐ λήθετ' ἐφετμέων<br/>παιδὸς ἑοῦ, ἀλλ' ἥ γ' ἀνεδύσετο κῦμα θαλάσσης.<br/>ἠερίη δ' ἀνέβη μέγαν οὐρανὸν Οὔλυμπόν τε.<br/>εὗρεν δ' εὐρύοπα Κρονίδην ἄτερ ἥμενον ἄλλων<br/>ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ πολυδειράδος Οὐλύμποιο:<br/>καί ῥα πάροιθ' αὐτοῖο καθέζετο, καὶ λάβε γούνων<br/>σκαιῇ, δεξιτερῇ δ' ἄρ' ὑπ' ἀνθερεῶνος ἑλοῦσα<br/>λισσομένη προσέειπε Δία Κρονίωνα ἄνακτα:<br/>Ζεῦ πάτερ εἴ ποτε δή σε μετ' ἀθανάτοισιν ὄνησα<br/>ἢ ἔπει ἢ ἔργῳ, τόδε μοι κρήηνον ἐέλδωρ:<br/>τίμησόν μοι υἱὸν ὃς ὠκυμορώτατος ἄλλων<br/>ἔπλετ': ἀτάρ μιν νῦν γε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων<br/>ἠτίμησεν: ἑλὼν γὰρ ἔχει γέρας αὐτὸς ἀπούρας.<br/>ἀλλὰ σύ πέρ μιν τῖσον Ὀλύμπιε μητίετα Ζεῦ:<br/>τόφρα δ' ἐπὶ Τρώεσσι τίθει κράτος ὄφρ' ἂν Ἀχαιοὶ<br/>υἱὸν ἐμὸν τίσωσιν ὀφέλλωσίν τέ ἑ τιμῇ.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So she spoke; but Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, spoke no word to her, but sat a long time in silence. Yet Thetis, even as she had clasped his knees, so held to him, clinging close, and questioned him again a second time: "Give me your infallible promise, and bow your head to it, or else deny me, for there is nothing to make you afraid; so that I may know well how far I among all the gods am honoured the least." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο: τὴν δ' οὔ τι προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς,<br/>ἀλλ' ἀκέων δὴν ἧστο: Θέτις δ' ὡς ἥψατο γούνων<br/>ὣς ἔχετ' ἐμπεφυυῖα, καὶ εἴρετο δεύτερον αὖτις:<br/>νημερτὲς μὲν δή μοι ὑπόσχεο καὶ κατάνευσον<br/>ἢ ἀπόειπ', ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἔπι δέος, ὄφρ' ἐὺ̈ εἰδέω<br/>ὅσσον ἐγὼ μετὰ πᾶσιν ἀτιμοτάτη θεός εἰμι.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then, greatly troubled, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer spoke to her: "Surely this will be sorry work, since you will set me on to engage in strife with Hera, when she shall anger me with taunting words.

But for the present, depart again, lest Hera note something; and I will take thought for these things to bring all to pass. Come, I will bow my head to you, that thou may be certain, for this from me is the surest token among the immortals; no word of mine may be recalled, nor is false, nor unfulfilled, to which I bow my head." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δὲ μέγ' ὀχθήσας προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:<br/>ἦ δὴ λοίγια ἔργ' ὅ τέ μ' ἐχθοδοπῆσαι ἐφήσεις<br/>Ἥρῃ ὅτ' ἄν μ' ἐρέθῃσιν ὀνειδείοις ἐπέεσσιν:<br/>ἣ δὲ καὶ αὔτως μ' αἰεὶ ἐν ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι<br/>νεικεῖ, καί τέ μέ φησι μάχῃ Τρώεσσιν ἀρήγειν.<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν αὖτις ἀπόστιχε μή τι νοήσῃ<br/>Ἥρη: ἐμοὶ δέ κε ταῦτα μελήσεται ὄφρα τελέσσω:<br/>εἰ δ' ἄγε τοι κεφαλῇ κατανεύσομαι ὄφρα πεποίθῃς:<br/>τοῦτο γὰρ ἐξ ἐμέθεν γε μετ' ἀθανάτοισι μέγιστον<br/>τέκμωρ: οὐ γὰρ ἐμὸν παλινάγρετον οὐδ' ἀπατηλὸν<br/>οὐδ' ἀτελεύτητον ὅ τί κεν κεφαλῇ κατανεύσω.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>The son of Cronos spoke, and bowed his dark brow in assent, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ἦ καὶ κυανέῃσιν ἐπ' ὀφρύσι νεῦσε Κρονίων:<br/>ἀμβρόσιαι δ' ἄρα χαῖται ἐπερρώσαντο ἄνακτος<br/>κρατὸς ἀπ' ἀθανάτοιο: μέγαν δ' ἐλέλιξεν Ὄλυμπον.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>When the two had taken counsel together in this way, they parted; she leapt straightway into the deep sea from gleaming Olympus, and Zeus went to his own palace. All the gods together rose from their seats before the face of their father; no one dared to await his coming, but they all rose up before him. So he sat down there upon his throne; but Hera saw, and failed not to note how silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, had taken counsel with him. Forthwith then she spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, with mocking words: "Who of the gods, crafty one, has now again taken counsel with you? Always is it your pleasure to hold aloof from me, and to give judgments which you have pondered in secret, nor have you ever brought yourself with a ready heart to declare to me the matter which you devise." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τώ γ' ὣς βουλεύσαντε διέτμαγεν: ἣ μὲν ἔπειτα<br/>εἰς ἅλα ἆλτο βαθεῖαν ἀπ' αἰγλήεντος Ὀλύμπου,<br/>Ζεὺς δὲ ἑὸν πρὸς δῶμα: θεοὶ δ' ἅμα πάντες ἀνέσταν<br/>ἐξ ἑδέων σφοῦ πατρὸς ἐναντίον: οὐδέ τις ἔτλη<br/>μεῖναι ἐπερχόμενον, ἀλλ' ἀντίοι ἔσταν ἅπαντες.<br/>ὣς ὃ μὲν ἔνθα καθέζετ' ἐπὶ θρόνου: οὐδέ μιν Ἥρη<br/>ἠγνοίησεν ἰδοῦσ' ὅτι οἱ συμφράσσατο βουλὰς<br/>ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις θυγάτηρ ἁλίοιο γέροντος.<br/>αὐτίκα κερτομίοισι Δία Κρονίωνα προσηύδα:<br/>τίς δ' αὖ τοι δολομῆτα θεῶν συμφράσσατο βουλάς;<br/>αἰεί τοι φίλον ἐστὶν ἐμεῦ ἀπὸ νόσφιν ἐόντα<br/>κρυπτάδια φρονέοντα δικαζέμεν: οὐδέ τί πώ μοι<br/>πρόφρων τέτληκας εἰπεῖν ἔπος ὅττι νοήσῃς.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to her spoke the father of men and gods: "Hera, do not hope to know all my words: hard will they prove for you, though you are my wife. Whatever it is fitting for you to hear, this none other shall know before you, whether of gods or men; but what I wish to devise apart from the gods, of all this do not in any way inquire nor ask." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δ' ἠμείβετ' ἔπειτα πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:<br/>Ἥρη μὴ δὴ πάντας ἐμοὺς ἐπιέλπεο μύθους<br/>εἰδήσειν: χαλεποί τοι ἔσοντ' ἀλόχῳ περ ἐούσῃ:<br/>ἀλλ' ὃν μέν κ' ἐπιεικὲς ἀκουέμεν οὔ τις ἔπειτα<br/>οὔτε θεῶν πρότερος τὸν εἴσεται οὔτ' ἀνθρώπων:<br/>ὃν δέ κ' ἐγὼν ἀπάνευθε θεῶν ἐθέλωμι νοῆσαι<br/>μή τι σὺ ταῦτα ἕκαστα διείρεο μηδὲ μετάλλα.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>In answer to him spoke the ox-eyed lady Hera: "Most dread son of Cronos, what a word you have said! Truly, in the past I have not been accustomed to inquire nor ask you, but at your ease you devise all things whatever you wish. But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, have beguiled you; for at early dawn she sat by you and clasped your knees. To her, I think, you bowed your head in sure token that you will honour Achilles, and bring many to death beside the ships of the Achaeans." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὸν δ' ἠμείβετ' ἔπειτα βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη:<br/>αἰνότατε Κρονίδη ποῖον τὸν μῦθον ἔειπες;<br/>καὶ λίην σε πάρος γ' οὔτ' εἴρομαι οὔτε μεταλλῶ,<br/>ἀλλὰ μάλ' εὔκηλος τὰ φράζεαι ἅσσ' ἐθέλῃσθα.<br/>νῦν δ' αἰνῶς δείδοικα κατὰ φρένα μή σε παρείπῃ<br/>ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις θυγάτηρ ἁλίοιο γέροντος:<br/>ἠερίη γὰρ σοί γε παρέζετο καὶ λάβε γούνων:<br/>τῇ σ' ὀί̈ω κατανεῦσαι ἐτήτυμον ὡς Ἀχιλῆα<br/>τιμήσῃς, ὀλέσῃς δὲ πολέας ἐπὶ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Then in answer to her spoke Zeus, the cloud-gatherer: "Strange one, you are always suspecting, and I do not escape you; yet you shall be able to accomplish nothing, but shall be even further from my heart; and that shall be the worse for you. If this thing is as you say, then it must be pleasing to me. Sit down in silence, and obey my word, lest all the gods that are in Olympus avail you not against my drawing near, when I put forth upon you my irresistible hands." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">τὴν δ' ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:<br/>δαιμονίη αἰεὶ μὲν ὀί̈εαι οὐδέ σε λήθω:<br/>πρῆξαι δ' ἔμπης οὔ τι δυνήσεαι, ἀλλ' ἀπὸ θυμοῦ<br/>μᾶλλον ἐμοὶ ἔσεαι: τὸ δέ τοι καὶ ῥίγιον ἔσται.<br/>εἰ δ' οὕτω τοῦτ' ἐστὶν ἐμοὶ μέλλει φίλον εἶναι:<br/>ἀλλ' ἀκέουσα κάθησο, ἐμῷ δ' ἐπιπείθεο μύθῳ,<br/>μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμωσιν ὅσοι θεοί εἰσ' ἐν Ὀλύμπῳ<br/>ἆσσον ἰόνθ', ὅτε κέν τοι ἀάπτους χεῖρας ἐφείω.</rtc></ruby> <ruby>He spoke, and ox-eyed lady Hera was seized with fear, and sat down in silence, curbing her heart. Then troubled were the gods of heaven throughout the palace of Zeus, and among them Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, was first to speak, doing pleasure to his dear mother, white-armed Hera: "Surely this will be sorry work, that is no longer bearable, if you two are to wrangle thus for mortals' sakes, and set the gods in tumult; neither will there be any joy in the excellent feast, since worse things prevail. And I give counsel to my mother, wise though she be herself, to do pleasure to our dear father Zeus, that the father upbraid her not again, and bring confusion upon our feast. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, were minded to dash us from our seats! for he is mightiest far. But address him with gentle words; so shall the Olympian forthwith be gracious to us." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἔφατ' ἔδεισεν δὲ βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη,<br/>καί ῥ' ἀκέουσα καθῆστο ἐπιγνάμψασα φίλον κῆρ:<br/>ὄχθησαν δ' ἀνὰ δῶμα Διὸς θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες:<br/>τοῖσιν δ' Ἥφαιστος κλυτοτέχνης ἦρχ' ἀγορεύειν<br/>μητρὶ φίλῃ ἐπίηρα φέρων λευκωλένῳ Ἥρῃ:<br/>ἦ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ' ἔσσεται οὐδ' ἔτ' ἀνεκτά,<br/>εἰ δὴ σφὼ ἕνεκα θνητῶν ἐριδαίνετον ὧδε,<br/>ἐν δὲ θεοῖσι κολῳὸν ἐλαύνετον: οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς<br/>ἐσθλῆς ἔσσεται ἦδος, ἐπεὶ τὰ χερείονα νικᾷ.<br/>μητρὶ δ' ἐγὼ παράφημι καὶ αὐτῇ περ νοεούσῃ<br/>πατρὶ φίλῳ ἐπίηρα φέρειν Διί, ὄφρα μὴ αὖτε<br/>νεικείῃσι πατήρ, σὺν δ' ἡμῖν δαῖτα ταράξῃ.<br/>εἴ περ γάρ κ' ἐθέλῃσιν Ὀλύμπιος ἀστεροπητὴς<br/>ἐξ ἑδέων στυφελίξαι: ὃ γὰρ πολὺ φέρτατός ἐστιν.<br/>ἀλλὰ σὺ τὸν ἐπέεσσι καθάπτεσθαι μαλακοῖσιν:<br/>αὐτίκ' ἔπειθ' ἵλαος Ὀλύμπιος ἔσσεται ἡμῖν.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So saying, he sprang up and placed in his dear mother's hand the double cup, and spoke to her: "Be patient, my mother, and endure for all your grief, lest, dear as you are to me, my eyes see you stricken, and then I shall in no way be able to succour you for all my sorrow; for a hard foe is the Olympian to meet in strife. On a time before this, when I was striving to save you, he caught me by the foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; the whole day long I was carried headlong, and at sunset I fell in Lemnos, and but little life was in me. There the Sintian folk quickly tended me for my fall." <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς ἄρ' ἔφη καὶ ἀναί̈ξας δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον<br/>μητρὶ φίλῃ ἐν χειρὶ τίθει καί μιν προσέειπε:<br/>τέτλαθι μῆτερ ἐμή, καὶ ἀνάσχεο κηδομένη περ,<br/>μή σε φίλην περ ἐοῦσαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδωμαι<br/>θεινομένην, τότε δ' οὔ τι δυνήσομαι ἀχνύμενός περ<br/>χραισμεῖν: ἀργαλέος γὰρ Ὀλύμπιος ἀντιφέρεσθαι:<br/>ἤδη γάρ με καὶ ἄλλοτ' ἀλεξέμεναι μεμαῶτα<br/>ῥῖψε ποδὸς τεταγὼν ἀπὸ βηλοῦ θεσπεσίοιο,<br/>πᾶν δ' ἦμαρ φερόμην, ἅμα δ' ἠελίῳ καταδύντι<br/>κάππεσον ἐν Λήμνῳ, ὀλίγος δ' ἔτι θυμὸς ἐνῆεν:<br/>ἔνθά με Σίντιες ἄνδρες ἄφαρ κομίσαντο πεσόντα.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>So he spoke, and the goddess, white-armed Hera, smiled, and smiling took in her hand the cup from her son. Then he poured wine for all the other gods from left to right, drawing forth sweet nectar from the bowl. And unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods, as they saw Hephaestus puffing through the palace. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη,<br/>μειδήσασα δὲ παιδὸς ἐδέξατο χειρὶ κύπελλον:<br/>αὐτὰρ ὃ τοῖς ἄλλοισι θεοῖς ἐνδέξια πᾶσιν<br/>οἰνοχόει γλυκὺ νέκταρ ἀπὸ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων:<br/>ἄσβεστος δ' ἄρ' ἐνῶρτο γέλως μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν<br/>ὡς ἴδον Ἥφαιστον διὰ δώματα ποιπνύοντα.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>Thus the whole day long till the setting of the sun they feasted, nor did their heart lack anything of the equal feast, nor of the beauteous lyre, that Apollo held, nor yet of the Muses, who sang, replying one to the other with sweet voices. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα<br/>δαίνυντ', οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐί̈σης,<br/>οὐ μὲν φόρμιγγος περικαλλέος ἣν ἔχ' Ἀπόλλων,<br/>Μουσάων θ' αἳ ἄειδον ἀμειβόμεναι ὀπὶ καλῇ.</rtc></ruby><br/><ruby>But when the bright light of the sun was set, they went each to his own house to take their rest, where for each one a palace had been built with cunning skill by the famed Hephaestus, the limping god; and Zeus, the Olympian, lord of the lightning, went to his couch, where of old he took his rest, whenever sweet sleep came upon him. There went he up and slept, and beside him lay Hera of the golden throne. <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατέδυ λαμπρὸν φάος ἠελίοιο,<br/>οἳ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκον δὲ ἕκαστος,<br/>ἧχι ἑκάστῳ δῶμα περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις<br/>Ἥφαιστος ποίησεν ἰδυίῃσι πραπίδεσσι:<br/>Ζεὺς δὲ πρὸς ὃν λέχος ἤϊ' Ὀλύμπιος ἀστεροπητής,<br/>ἔνθα πάρος κοιμᾶθ' ὅτε μιν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἱκάνοι:<br/>ἔνθα καθεῦδ' ἀναβάς, παρὰ δὲ χρυσόθρονος Ἥρη.</rtc></ruby></ol><nav><a href="#!/" rel="contents">Table of Contents</a> <a href="#!/iliad/book2/" rel="next">Next</a></nav></section><ul hidden><li><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/homer/greek/ili01.htm" target="_blank"><cite>The Iliad</cite></a></li><li><a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0133" target="_blank"><cite>The Iliad</cite>, on Perseus</a></li><li><a href="https://issuu.com/john_jackson/docs/iliad_interlinear_book_1/10" target="_blank"><cite>The Iliad of Homer a Parsed Interlinear Text</cite>, by <u>John Jackson</u></a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Iliad_(Murray)/Book_I" target="_blank"><cite>The Iliad</cite>, translated by <u>Augustus Taber Murray</u></a></li></ul></article>
