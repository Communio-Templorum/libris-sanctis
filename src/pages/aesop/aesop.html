<h3 itemprop="name">The Wolf and the Lamb</h3>
<p>Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on her, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf's right to eat her. He thus addressed her: "Last year you grossly insulted me."</p>
<p>"Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."</p>
<p>Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."</p>
<p>"No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."</p>
<p>Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my well."</p>
<p>"No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."</p>
<p>Upon which the Wolf seized her and ate her up, saying, "Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations."</p>
<p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">The Bat and the Weasels</h3>
<p>A Bat who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.</p>

The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim</p>
<p>"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion."</p>
