<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Wolf and the Lamb <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Λύκος και αρήν</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on her, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf's right to eat her. He thus addressed her: "Last year you grossly insulted me."</p>
<p>"Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."</p>
<p>Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."</p>
<p>"No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."</p>
<p>Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my well."</p>
<p>"No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."</p>
<p>Upon which the Wolf seized her and ate her up, saying, "Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations."</p>
<p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>
<rtc lang="grc" translate="no">
<p>Λύκος είδε ένα αρνάκι που έπινε απο ένα ποτάμι, κ ήθελε να το σπαράξει κ να το φάει. Τότε είπε: "κατηγορείσαι οτι θολώνεις το νερό του ποταμού κ δέν αφήνεις εμένα να πιώ! Γι' αυτό η τιμωρίασου θα είναι να σε φάω!" - "μα πώς είναι δυνατόν, αγαπητέμου λύκε", απάντησε το αρνάκι, "να θολώνω ολόκληρο ποταμό μόνο που ακουμπάω τα χείλημου; Άλλωστε το ρεύμα του ποταμού έρχεται προς τη δικήμου μεριά, όχι προς τη δικήσου για να σου φέρει, άν υποθέσουμε, κάποια βρωμιά απο εμένα!". - "Ά, ναί; Ωστόσο κ πάλι σε καταδικάζω εις θάνατον για συκοφαντική δυσφήμιση, γιατί κορόϊδεψες τον πατέραμου!" - "Εγώ, να κοροϊδέψω τον πατέρασου, που ούτε κάν τον ξέρω; Πότε έγινε τέτοιο πράγμα;" - "Πέρσι τέτοια εποχή" - "Μα πέρσι εγώ ούτε είχα γεννηθεί! Φέτος γεννήθηκα!". Λέει τότε ο λύκος: "Βλέπω το έχεις εύκολο να βρίσκεις ωραίες δικαιολογίες· αλλα με τις δικαιολογίεςσου άν νόμισες οτι δέν θα σε φάω, είσαι πολύ γελασμένο!" - κ ορμά στο αρνάκι!</p>

<p>The Ants were employing a fine winter's day in drying grain collected in the summer time. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants enquired of him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?" He replied, "I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing."

<p>A Hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise. The latter, laughing, said: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race." The Hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was, comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>

Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf.

The father resolved to kill the Snake, and the next day, on its coming out of its hole for food, took up his axe; but, making too much haste to hit him as he wriggled away, missed his head, and cut off only the end of his tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid lest the Snake should bite him also, endeavoured to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in his hole. The Snake, slightly hissing, said: "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."</p>

<p>A Pedlar, dealing in salt, drove his Ass to the sea-shore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream, in passing which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident into the water, and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the salt. The Pedlar retraced his steps, and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Pedlar saw through his trick, and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the knave, when he reached the stream, fell down on purpose, when the sponges becoming swollen with the water, his load was very greatly increased; and thus his trick recoiled on himself in fitting to his back a doubled burden.</p>

<p>A Goatherd, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found some wild goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the night. On the morrow it snowed very hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding-places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly, in the hope of enticing them to stay with him, and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd taxed them with their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them turning about said to him, "That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would, in the same manner, prefer them to ourselves."</p>

<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Ass and His Masters <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Όνος και κηπουρός</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>An Ass, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master. Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation, said, groaning: "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him."</p>

They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes.

<p>A Hound, having startled a Hare on the hillside, pursued her for some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog. The Hare said to him, "I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?"</p>

When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend.

But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: "I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?"</p>
<p>It is the same with men: when you give a deposit to greedy people, it is natural that you lose it.</p>

<ruby>
<p>A Nightingale, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down and seized him. The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds. The Hawk, interrupting him, said: "I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight."</p>

<p>A certain man made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for sale. When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders said to him, "My good fellow, why do you sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?" "Why," he replied, "I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts very slowly."</p>

<p>A man once kept a Goat and an Ass.

The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a doctor, asked his advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat.

<ruby>
<p>A Lion, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his destruction. He approached the Bull and said, "I have slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your company." The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage, and make his meal on him. The Bull, on approaching the Lion's den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause for offense. "I have reasons enough," said the Bull. "I see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull."</p>
