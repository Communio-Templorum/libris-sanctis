<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Wolf and the Lamb <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Λύκος και αρήν</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on her, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf's right to eat her. He thus addressed her: "Last year you grossly insulted me."</p>
<p>"Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."</p>
<p>Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."</p>
<p>"No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."</p>
<p>Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my well."</p>
<p>"No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."</p>
<p>Upon which the Wolf seized her and ate her up, saying, "Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations."</p>
<p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>
<rtc lang="grc" translate="no">
<p>Λύκος είδε ένα αρνάκι που έπινε απο ένα ποτάμι, κ ήθελε να το σπαράξει κ να το φάει. Τότε είπε: "κατηγορείσαι οτι θολώνεις το νερό του ποταμού κ δέν αφήνεις εμένα να πιώ! Γι' αυτό η τιμωρίασου θα είναι να σε φάω!" - "μα πώς είναι δυνατόν, αγαπητέμου λύκε", απάντησε το αρνάκι, "να θολώνω ολόκληρο ποταμό μόνο που ακουμπάω τα χείλημου; Άλλωστε το ρεύμα του ποταμού έρχεται προς τη δικήμου μεριά, όχι προς τη δικήσου για να σου φέρει, άν υποθέσουμε, κάποια βρωμιά απο εμένα!". - "Ά, ναί; Ωστόσο κ πάλι σε καταδικάζω εις θάνατον για συκοφαντική δυσφήμιση, γιατί κορόϊδεψες τον πατέραμου!" - "Εγώ, να κοροϊδέψω τον πατέρασου, που ούτε κάν τον ξέρω; Πότε έγινε τέτοιο πράγμα;" - "Πέρσι τέτοια εποχή" - "Μα πέρσι εγώ ούτε είχα γεννηθεί! Φέτος γεννήθηκα!". Λέει τότε ο λύκος: "Βλέπω το έχεις εύκολο να βρίσκεις ωραίες δικαιολογίες· αλλα με τις δικαιολογίεςσου άν νόμισες οτι δέν θα σε φάω, είσαι πολύ γελασμένο!" - κ ορμά στο αρνάκι!</p>

<p>A Hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise. The latter, laughing, said: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race." The Hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was, comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>

The father resolved to kill the Snake, and the next day, on its coming out of its hole for food, took up his axe; but, making too much haste to hit him as he wriggled away, missed his head, and cut off only the end of his tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid lest the Snake should bite him also, endeavoured to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in his hole. The Snake, slightly hissing, said: "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."</p>

<p>A Lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears, and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse. A Fox seeing him, said: "A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a Mouse." "'Tis not the Mouse I fear," said the Lion; "I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding."</p>

<p>A Pedlar, dealing in salt, drove his Ass to the sea-shore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream, in passing which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident into the water, and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the salt. The Pedlar retraced his steps, and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Pedlar saw through his trick, and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the knave, when he reached the stream, fell down on purpose, when the sponges becoming swollen with the water, his load was very greatly increased; and thus his trick recoiled on himself in fitting to his back a doubled burden.</p>

<p>A Goatherd, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found some wild goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the night. On the morrow it snowed very hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding-places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly, in the hope of enticing them to stay with him, and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd taxed them with their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them turning about said to him, "That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would, in the same manner, prefer them to ourselves."</p>

<p>A Dog used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to bite them without notice.

An old hound said to him: "Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself?
