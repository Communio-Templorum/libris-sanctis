<ruby>
<p>A Lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: "If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness." The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim</p>
<p>"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion."</p>

<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Kingdom of the Lion <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Λέοντος βασιλεία</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>It is once said that a Lion became king of beasts who was neither fierce, nor bloodthirsty, nor violent: he had strength, but also meekness and justice, like an ideal human being. When this Lion reigned, all the animals gathered and sued as many animals as were wronged, judged and condemned the animals that were wronged: thus the sheep punished the wolf, the antelope the leopard, the deer the tiger, the hare the dog. Then the hare said: "how much I wanted to see her on this day, when the violent were to be feared by the weak!"</p>
<p>This is what happens when a human society is ruled by a powerful but good-natured ruler: there the law of the most violent ceases to apply, and human justice applies: no one can steal, deceive and go unpunished.</p>

<p>A Hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise. The latter, laughing, said: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race." The Hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was, comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Tortoise and the Eagle <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Χελώνη και αετός</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A Tortoise, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle hovering near, heard her lamentation, and demanded what reward she would give him, if he would take her aloft, and float her in the air. "I will give you," she said, "all the riches of the Red Sea." "I will teach you to fly then," said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons, he carried her almost to the clouds,—when suddenly letting her go, she fell on a lofty mountain, and dashed her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: "I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?"</p>

His road home lay across a stream, in passing which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident into the water, and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the salt. The Pedlar retraced his steps, and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Pedlar saw through his trick, and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the knave, when he reached the stream, fell down on purpose, when the sponges becoming swollen with the water, his load was very greatly increased; and thus his trick recoiled on himself in fitting to his back a doubled burden.</p>

He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly, in the hope of enticing them to stay with him, and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd taxed them with their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them turning about said to him, "That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would, in the same manner, prefer them to ourselves."</p>

<p>A Horse Soldier took the utmost pains with his charger. As long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies, and fed him carefully with hay and corn.

The Horse fell down straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master, "You must now go to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?"</p>

<ruby>
<p>A Lion roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The Dolphin gladly consented to this request. Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin replied, "Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the land."</p>

<p>On a summer day, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink.

When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall first.

<p>The Weasels and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Weasels.</p>

When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens).

<p>A Jackdaw, seeing some Doves in a cottage abundantly provided with food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to their cottage. But when one day he forgot himself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth, pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food among the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing him on account of his color. expelled him from living with them.

<p>A Horse, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized himself. The Horse chose his earliest years and gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.</p>

When the Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then said to himself, "I shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other."</p>

<p>Two Men, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first.

<p>A Lion, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came to visit their king, except the Fox.

At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and said, "And who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians the means of healing you?" The Lion commanded him immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, "You must flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you." The Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, "You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will."</p>

<p>All the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could not live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection. Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound, for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means singly: while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those who are able to discern them.</p>

He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief. And, lastly, he loudly complained against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant.

Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would; and having learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the stream and brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the very same axe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool.</p>

<p>A Peasant had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The King's Son and the Painted Lion <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Παις και λέων γεγραμμένος</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A King, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion. When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: "O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to you?' With these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion. But one of the tree's prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later.</p>

<p>Υἱόν τις μονογενῆ γέρων δειλὸς ἔχων γενναῖον καὶ κυνηγεῖν ἐφιέμενον, τοῦτον καθ’ ὕπνους εἶδεν ὑπὸ λέοντος θανατωθέντα. Φοβηθεὶς δὲ μὴ ὕπαρ γένηται καὶ ἀληθεύσῃ ὁ ὄνειρος, οἴκημα κάλλιστον καὶ μετέωρον κατασκευάσας, ἐκεῖσε τὸν υἱὸν παρεφύλαττε. Ἐζωγράφησε δὲ καὶ τὸ οἴκημα πρὸς τέρψιν παντοίοις ζῴοις, ἐν οἷς καὶ λέων ἐμορφώθη. Ὁ δὲ ταῦτα μᾶλλον ὁρῶν πλείω τὴν λύπην εἶχε. Καὶ δήποτε πλησίον τοῦ λέοντος στάς· «Ὦ κάκιστον θηρίον, εἶπε, διὰ σὲ καὶ τὸν ψεύστην ὄνειρον τοῦ ἐμοῦ πατρὸς γυναικείᾳ ἐνεκλείσθην φρουρᾷ· τί σοι ποιήσω;» Καὶ εἰπὼν ἐπέβαλε τὴν χεῖρα τῷ τοίχῳ ὡς τυφλώσων τὸν λέοντα. Σκόλοψ δὲ τῷ ὄνυχι αὐτοῦ ὑπεισδὺς ἄλγημα ὀξὺ καὶ φλεγμονὴν μέχρι βουβώνων εἰργάσατο· πυρετός τε ἐπὶ τούτοις ἀνάψας τὸν παῖδα θᾶττον τοῦ βίου ὑπεξήγαγεν. Ὁ δὲ λέων καίπερ γραπτὸς ὢν τοῦτον ἀνῃρήκει, μηδὲν τῷ τοῦ πατρὸς ὠφεληθέντα σοφίσματι.</p>
<p>Ὅτι ἃ δὴ μέλλει συμβαίνειν τινί, ἐγκαρτερείτω τούτοις γενναίως καὶ μὴ σοφιζέσθω· οὐ γὰρ ἐκφεύξεται.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Ναυαγός και θάλασσα</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A shipwrecked man, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after his buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him: "Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury."</p>

<p>Ναυαγὸς ἐκβρασθεὶς εἰς τὸν αἰγιαλὸν ἐκοιμᾶτο διὰ τὸν κόπον· μετὰ μικρὸν δὲ ἐξαναστάς, ὡς ἐθεάσατο τὴν θάλασσαν, ἐμέμφετο αὐτῇ ὅτι γε δελεάζουσα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῇ πραότητι τῆς συνόψεως, ἡνίκα ἂν αὐτοὺς προσδέξηται, ἀπαγριουμένη διαφθείρει. Ἡ δὲ ὁμοιωθεῖσα γυναικὶ ἔφη πρὸς αὐτόν· «Ἀλλ’, ὦ οὗτος, μὴ ἐμὲ μέμφου, ἀλλὰ τοὺς ἀνέμους· ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ φύσει τοιαύτη εἰμὶ ὁποίαν καὶ νῦν με ὁρᾷς· οἱ δὲ αἰφνίδιόν με ἐπέρχονται καὶ κυματοῦσι καὶ ἐξαγριοῦσιν.»</p>
<p>Ἀτὰρ οὖν καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τῶν ἀδικημάτων οὐ δεῖ τοὺς δρῶντας αἰτιᾶσθαι, ὅταν ἑτέροις ὑποτεταγμένοι ὦσι, τοὺς δὲ τούτοις ἐπιστατοῦντας.</p>
