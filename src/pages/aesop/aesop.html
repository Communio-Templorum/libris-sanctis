<h3 itemprop="name"><ruby>The Wolf and the Lamb <rtc lang="grc" translate="no">Λύκος και αρήν</ruby></h3>
<ruby>
<p>A Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on her, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf's right to eat her. He thus addressed her: "Last year you grossly insulted me."</p>
<p>"Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."</p>
<p>Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."</p>
<p>"No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."</p>
<p>Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my well."</p>
<p>"No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."</p>
<p>Upon which the Wolf seized her and ate her up, saying, "Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations."</p>
<p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>
<rtc lang="grc" translate="no">
<p>Λύκος είδε ένα αρνάκι που έπινε απο ένα ποτάμι, κ ήθελε να το σπαράξει κ να το φάει. Τότε είπε: "κατηγορείσαι οτι θολώνεις το νερό του ποταμού κ δέν αφήνεις εμένα να πιώ! Γι' αυτό η τιμωρίασου θα είναι να σε φάω!" - "μα πώς είναι δυνατόν, αγαπητέμου λύκε", απάντησε το αρνάκι, "να θολώνω ολόκληρο ποταμό μόνο που ακουμπάω τα χείλημου; Άλλωστε το ρεύμα του ποταμού έρχεται προς τη δικήμου μεριά, όχι προς τη δικήσου για να σου φέρει, άν υποθέσουμε, κάποια βρωμιά απο εμένα!". - "Ά, ναί; Ωστόσο κ πάλι σε καταδικάζω εις θάνατον για συκοφαντική δυσφήμιση, γιατί κορόϊδεψες τον πατέραμου!" - "Εγώ, να κοροϊδέψω τον πατέρασου, που ούτε κάν τον ξέρω; Πότε έγινε τέτοιο πράγμα;" - "Πέρσι τέτοια εποχή" - "Μα πέρσι εγώ ούτε είχα γεννηθεί! Φέτος γεννήθηκα!". Λέει τότε ο λύκος: "Βλέπω το έχεις εύκολο να βρίσκεις ωραίες δικαιολογίες· αλλα με τις δικαιολογίεςσου άν νόμισες οτι δέν θα σε φάω, είσαι πολύ γελασμένο!" - κ ορμά στο αρνάκι!</p>

<p>A Hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise. The latter, laughing, said: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race." The Hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was, comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>

The father resolved to kill the Snake, and the next day, on its coming out of its hole for food, took up his axe; but, making too much haste to hit him as he wriggled away, missed his head, and cut off only the end of his tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid lest the Snake should bite him also, endeavoured to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in his hole. The Snake, slightly hissing, said: "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."</p>

His road home lay across a stream, in passing which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident into the water, and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the salt. The Pedlar retraced his steps, and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before.

He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly, in the hope of enticing them to stay with him, and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd taxed them with their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them turning about said to him, "That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would, in the same manner, prefer them to ourselves."</p>

<ruby>
<p>An Ass, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master. Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation, said, groaning: "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him."</p>

They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes.

<p>A Lion and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely for its possession.
