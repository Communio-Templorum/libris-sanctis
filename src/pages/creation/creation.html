	<ruby>Before the sea and the earth, and the sky which covers all
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia caelum</ruby>
	<ruby>there was one, the whole of nature looking over the world,

	<dl>
		<dt>Chaos</dt>
			<dd lang="grc" translate="no">χάος</dd>
	</dl>
	<ruby>which they called Chaos: a rough and confused mass
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">quem dixere chaos: rudis indigestaque moles</ruby>
	<ruby>and there was nothing but this inert weight
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem</ruby>
	<ruby>not well joined, the discordant seeds of things.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">non bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum.</ruby>
	<ruby>No sun shone light upon the world, nor the moon's horns;</li>
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan, nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe,</ruby>
	<dl>
		<dt>Earth</dt>
			<dd lang="grc" translate="no">Γαῖα</dd>
			<dd lang="la" translate="no">Terra</dd>
	</dl>
	<ruby>nor was the earth floating in the air,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus ponderibus librata suis,</ruby>
	<ruby>nor was a long ocean stretched;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nec bracchia longo margine terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite;</ruby>
	<ruby>nor was there land or sea or air.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">utque erat et tellus illic et pontus et aer,</ruby>
	<ruby>In one body there was cold conflicting against heat, wet against dry, soft against hard,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">quia corpore in uno frigida pugnabant calidis, umentia siccis, mollia cum duris,</ruby>
	<ruby>and that with weight conflicting against that without weight.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">idque pondere pondus contra opponi.</ruby>
	<ruby>Chaos broke apart this strife.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit.</ruby>
	<ruby>He separated the lands from the sea and the liquid apart from the air.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nam caelo terras et terris abscidit undas et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere caelum.</ruby>
	<ruby>That which He had disengaged and extricated from the blind heap, He bound disjoined in their places in concordant peace:
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">quae postquam evolvit caecoque exemit acervo, dissociata locis concordi pace ligavit:</ruby>
	<ruby>The fiery force of the heavens bowed outward and that without weight shot forth and chose for itself a place in the highest citadel;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">ignea convexi vis et sine pondere caeli emicuit summaque locum sibi fecit in arce;</ruby>
	<ruby>The air is next to it in lightness and in place;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">proximus est aer illi levitate locoque;</ruby>
	<ruby>The earth is denser than these and drew with it the gross elements and was pressed by gravity into itself;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">densior his tellus elementaque grandia traxit et pressa est gravitate sua;</ruby>
	<ruby>The waters flowing round possessed the last places and bound together the solid globe.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">circumfluus umor ultima possedit solidumque coercuit orbem.</ruby>

<summary>Building the Land, Climates, and Winds</summary>
<ol>
	<ruby>When He had divided the heap thus arranged, He had reduced it divided into members:
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Sic ubi dispositam congeriem secuit sectamque in membra coegit,</ruby>
	<ruby>First He collected the land into the form of a great globe, lest it might not be equal in every part.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">principio terram, ne non aequalis ab omni parte foret, magni speciem glomeravit in orbis.</ruby>
	<ruby>He ordered the seas to be poured abroad and to swell with the rapid winds and to surround the shores of the compassed earth.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">tum freta diffundi rapidisque tumescere ventis iussit et ambitae circumdare litora terrae;</ruby>
	<ruby>He added also fountains, and immense pools and lakes;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">addidit et fontes et stagna inmensa lacusque</ruby>
	<ruby>And He girt with sloping banks the descending rivers, which, different in their places, are partially absorbed by the earth itself,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">fluminaque obliquis cinxit declivia ripis, quae, diversa locis, partim sorbentur ab ipsa,</ruby>
	<ruby>and others arrive into the seas and, being received in the plain of freer water, beat shores instead of banks.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">in mare perveniunt partim campoque recepta liberioris aquae pro ripis litora pulsant.</ruby>
	<ruby>He ordered also plains to be stretch out, valleys to sink down, woods to be covered with foliage, and stoney mountains to rise,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">iussit et extendi campos, subsidere valles, fronde tegi silvas, lapidosos surgere montes,</ruby>
	<!-- The Five Zones, Metamorphoses line 46-52 -->
	<ruby>and as two zones cut the sky on the right part, and as many on the left, and a fifth part hotter than those,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">utque duae dextra caelum totidemque sinistra parte secant zonae, quinta est ardentior illis,</ruby>
	<ruby>so the care of God distinguished by the same number the included mass, and as many climes are marked out of the earth:
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem cura dei, totidemque plagae tellure premuntur.</ruby>
	<ruby>Of which that which is in the middle is not habitable from heat; Deep snow covers two others
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">quarum quae media est, non est habitabilis aestu; nix tegit alta duas;</ruby>
	<ruby>He placed as many between these climes and gave them temperateness, flame being mixed with cold.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">totidem inter utramque locavit temperiemque dedit mixta cum frigore flamma.</ruby>
	<!-- The Four Winds, Metamorphoses line 53-68 -->
	<ruby>Over these impends the air, which is by so much heavier than fire, as the weight of water is lighter than the weight of the earth.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Inminet his aer, qui, quanto est pondere terrae pondus aquae levius, tanto est onerosior igni,</ruby>
	<ruby>And there He ordered vapors, there clouds to collect, and thunders about to move human minds, and with thunderbolts winds producing cold.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">illic et nebulas, illic consistere nubes iussit et humanas motura tonitrua mentes et cum fulminibus facientes fulgura ventos.</ruby>
	<ruby>By these also the Architect of the world permitted not everywhere the air to be held;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">His quoque non passim mundi fabricator habendum aera permisit;</ruby>
	<ruby class="revise">Even now, hardly is resistance made to them but that they tear the world, since they, each one, their own blasts in a different draught, so great is the discord of the brothers.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">vix nunc obsistitur illis, cum sua quisque regat diverso flamina tractu, quin lanient mundum; tanta est discordia fratrum.</ruby>
	<ruby>Eurus retired to Aurora and the Nabathaean kingdoms, and Persis, and the hilltops situated under the morning rays
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Eurus ad Auroram Nabataeaque regna recessit Persidaque et radiis iuga subdita matutinis;</ruby>
	<ruby>Vesper and shores which grow warm with the setting sun, are nearest to Zephyr;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">vesper et occiduo quae litora sole tepescunt, proxima sunt Zephyro;</ruby>
	<ruby>Chill-bringing Boreas invaded Scythia and the north
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Scythiam septemque triones horrifer invasit Boreas;</ruby>
	<ruby>The opposite land grows wet from settled clouds and rainy Auster.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">contraria tellus nubibus adsiduis pluviaque madescit ab Austro.</ruby>
	<ruby>Over these he placed ether, liquid and void of weight, nor having aught of earthly dregs.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">haec super inposuit liquidum et gravitate carentem aethera nec quicquam terrenae faecis habentem.</ruby>

<summary>Creating Animals and Man</summary>
<ol>
	<!-- Animals, Metamorphoses, lines 69-75 -->
	<ruby>Scarcely had He separated all these within certain limits, when the stars, which had lay hidden under that mass, began to blaze out in the whole sky.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Vix ita limitibus dissaepserat omnia certis, cum, quae pressa diu fuerant caligine caeca, sidera coeperunt toto effervescere caelo;</ruby>
	<ruby>And lest any region might be destitute of its own animals, the stars and the forms of Gods hold the celestial floor;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">neu regio foret ulla suis animalibus orba, astra tenent caeleste solum formaeque deorum,</ruby>
	<ruby>the waters gave way to be inhabited by glittering fishes;
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">cesserunt nitidis habitandae piscibus undae,</ruby>
	<ruby>the land received wild beasts, and the air the flying birds.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">terra feras cepit, volucres agitabilis aer.</ruby>
	<!-- Humankind, Metamorphoses, lines 76-87 -->
	<ruby>An animal more sacred than these, and more capable of a lofty mind, and might be able to rule of the rest, was still wanting.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Sanctius his animal mentisque capacius altae deerat adhuc et quod dominari in cetera posset:</ruby>
	<ruby>Man was born; whether that maker of all things, the origin of a better world, made him from divine seed,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">natus homo est, sive hunc divino semine fecit ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo,</ruby>
	<ruby>or Earth still new and lately severed from the lofty aether retained seeds of the kindred sky,
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">sive recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto aethere cognati retinebat semina caeli.</ruby>
	<ruby>which the son of Iapetus mixed with river waters and fashioned into the image of the Gods who contol all things.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">quam satus Iapeto, mixtam pluvialibus undis, finxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum,</ruby>
	<ruby>The other animals groveling look at earth, He gave to man a lofty aspect and ordered him to view the sky and to raise his uplifted looks to the stars.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram, os homini sublime dedit caelumque videre iussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus:</ruby>
	<ruby>Thus, the earth which had been just now rude and without shape, being changed, put on the unknown figures of men.

Iuppiter antiqui contraxit tempora veris
perque hiemes aestusque et inaequalis autumnos
et breve ver spatiis exegit quattuor annum.
tum primum siccis aer fervoribus ustus
canduit, et ventis glacies adstricta pependit;
tum primum subiere domos; domus antra fuerunt
et densi frutices et vinctae cortice virgae.
semina tum primum longis Cerealia sulcis
obruta sunt, pressique iugo gemuere iuvenci.

<summary>Allah Deceives Adam</summary>
<ol>
	<li>The Titans sat and decided together that Allah may live, but not with them</li>
	<li>Allah ran east to the river Indus</li>
	<li>He soon found a man and a woman in a garden serene</li>
	<li>They ate amongst the trees naked without strife</li>
	<li>Allah came to walk with Adam and his Eve</li>
	<li>Allah watched over the couple and protected them</li>
	<li>He set down a tree of Knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>Allah told His Adam and Eve not to eat from His tree</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did agree</li>
	<li>When Allah was away, the serpent of Lucifer, Son of Aurora, went to talk to Eve</li>
	<li>Eve told she was afraid of Allah if she were to eat from His tree of Knowledge</li>
	<li>The serpent said she could eat the fruit from the tree of Knowledge without fear</li>
	<li>The serpent said the fruit would open her eyes and she would become as Allah</li>
	<li>And so she picked a fruit and ate and her eyes were opened</li>
	<li>She knew then of the Titans and their power over Allah</li>
	<li>She took a fruit from the tree to Adam and offered it to him</li>
	<li>And so they ate the fruit together</li>
	<li>And so their eyes became open</li>
	<li>And they knew then of the Gods</li>
	<li>And of Their power over Allah</li>
	<li>And they were not afraid</li>
	<li>When Allah walked through the garden, he found them eating the forbidden fruit</li>
	<li>Allah went to destroy Adam and his Eve as punishment, but Indus took them to Her mother Tethys</li>
	<li>Oceanus dismissed Adam and his Eve under the care of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates</li>
	<li>Saturn took pity on Adam and his Eve and brought food to the deserts around them</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did build a temple to the Gods and named it Eridu</li>
	<li>But Adam did confuse Saturn and Oceanus as the single Enki</li>
	<li>Saturn punished Adam by hiding the food under the sand</li>
	<li>Adam labored to bring the waters borne under Oceanus to the plants of Saturn to raise them above the sand</li>
	<li>Eve labored to gather the food from the plants and bring them to their hungry babes</li>
	<li>And so the Sons of Adam lived in a Silver Age for five hundred years.</li>

Tertia post illam successit aenea proles,
saevior ingeniis et ad horrida promptior arma,
non scelerata tamen; de duro est ultima ferro.
protinus inrupit venae peioris in aevum
omne nefas: fugere pudor verumque fidesque;
in quorum subiere locum fraudesque dolusque
insidiaeque et vis et amor sceleratus habendi.
vela dabant ventis nec adhuc bene noverat illos
navita, quaeque prius steterant in montibus altis,
fluctibus ignotis insultavere carinae,
communemque prius ceu lumina solis et auras
cautus humum longo signavit limite mensor.
nec tantum segetes alimentaque debita dives
poscebatur humus, sed itum est in viscera terrae,
quasque recondiderat Stygiisque admoverat umbris,
effodiuntur opes, inritamenta malorum.
iamque nocens ferrum ferroque nocentius aurum
prodierat, prodit bellum, quod pugnat utroque,
sanguineaque manu crepitantia concutit arma.
vivitur ex rapto: non hospes ab hospite tutus,
non socer a genero, fratrum quoque gratia rara est;
inminet exitio vir coniugis, illa mariti,
lurida terribiles miscent aconita novercae,
filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos:
victa iacet pietas, et virgo caede madentis
ultima caelestum terras Astraea reliquit.

	<li>Prometheus was now helper of Saturn</li>
	<li>He did discover the Sons of Adam in Mesopotamia, who did divide themselves into three groups</li>
	<li>The Sons of Abel, first son of Adam, had led their herds of cattle away to Africa</li>
	<li>The Sons of Cain, second son of Adam, had followed Cain north to Greece</li>
	<li>The Sons of Seth, third son of Adam, had built cities in the land of Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>Prometheus took fire from the Gods and gave it to Enmenluana, first son of Seth</li>
	<li>Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, took as His wife Pandora, a nomadic daughter of Cain</li>
	<li>As their wedding gift, Saturn gave them a box that was never to be opened</li>
	<li>Driven by curiosity, Pandora took a peak in the box</li>
	<li>Out from the box came the evils of the world</li>
	<li>Illness, famine, and strife were until then unknown</li>
	<li>Modesty, truth, and loyalty were replaced with treachery, deceit, and greed</li>
	<li>Men fought for land, power, and wealth</li>
	<li>Friend betrayed friend, relative betrayed relative</li>
	<li>This caused much suffering and wickedness</li>

	<li>Indeed they were virtuous people</li>
	<li>They prayed to the Gods above to save their lifes</li>
	<li>Saturn released the North Wind to clear the storms and the clouds</li>
	<li>Oceanus did call upon Triton to recall the tides</li>
	<li>Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha came down the mountain to the newly dry land</li>
	<li>They saw they were all whom were left</li>
	<li>They walked along the stream of Cephisus and asked the old oracle for guidance</li>
	<li>Justitia told them to go forth and throw behind them the bones of their great mother</li>
	<li>Both left in shock of the disgrace to the spirits of their mothers</li>
	<li>Then at last the son of Prometheus calmed the daughter of Epimetheus</li>
	<li>Pyrrha spoke in the ear of Deucalion:</li>
	<li>"Surely Terra is the Mother of all animals and men,</li>
	<li>"The hard rocks in the ground her bones,</li>
	<li>"Let us pick them up and give them a toss."</li>
	<li>So they each picked up rocks from the lines of the streams</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Deucalion did grow into men</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Pyrrha did grow into women</li>
