<h2>History of the Creation of the World</h2>
<section>
<ol>
	<li>In the beginning was Chaos</li>
	<li>Chaos split itself in two to form Terra below and Allah above</li>
	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to three beasts Centimani</li>
	<li>The three were born with hundred hands and fifty heads</li>
	<li>Allah was unable to lay his eyes upon the three and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to three giants Cyclopes</li>
	<li>The three were born with a single eye and great fury</li>
	<li>Allah was fearful of their strength and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to six gods and six goddesses</li>
	<li>They came to this world in the image of the Father and the Mother</li>
	<li>Allah though feared their power and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>Terra would weep and Allah would ignore her cries</li>
	<li>And so the world would sit barren for five hundred years</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>Father Allah and Mother Terra had six Daughters and six Sons, the Titans as follows:</li>
	<li>Oceanus god of the wild sea, Tethys goddess of the seas, and their children, the Oceanid nymphs of the water sources;</li>
	<li>Polus god of Intelligence, with goddess Phoebe, begot Leto, Asteria, and Hekate;</li>
	<li>Hyperion god of observation, Theia goddess of sight, and their children Helios, Luna, and Aurora;</li>
	<li>The gods Iapetus and Crius;</li>
	<li>Mnemosyne goddess of memory; Justitia goddess of divine order;</li>
	<li>and then Saturn god of agriculture and His wife Ops goddess of the harvest.</li>
	<li>Allah feared the power of the Titans and so locked them in the underworld of Tartarus</li>
	<li>This did cause Terra much discomfort</li>
	<li>With a plan in hand, Terra freed Saturn</li>
	<li>As Allah went to lay with Terra, Saturn did castrate Allah</li>
	<li>Allah fought back, but was sent into exile</li>
	<li>Saturn freed the Titans and ruled as King</li>
	<li>Saturn had His brother Oceanus form the seas and His sister Tethys form the rivers</li>
	<li>Saturn created the plants with His sister Ops</li>
	<li>Saturn had Epimetheus, Son of Iapetus by the Oceanid Clymene, create the animals of the world</li>
	<li>Saturn had Prometheus, Son of Iapetus by the Oceanid Clymene, create man in His image</li>
	<li>All were living in peace as Terra gave her fruits without cultivation or labor</li>
	<li>And so the world was in a Golden Age for five hundred years.</li>

	<li>Allah ran east, away from eyes of Saturn</li>
	<li>He soon found a man and a woman in a garden serene along the river Indus</li>
	<li>They ate amongst the trees naked without strife</li>
	<li>Allah came to walk with Adam and his Eve</li>
	<li>Allah watched over the couple and protected them</li>
	<li>He set down a tree of Knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>Allah told His Adam and Eve not to eat from His tree</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did agree</li>
	<li>When Allah was away, the serpent of Lucifer, Son of Aurora, went to talk to Eve</li>
	<li>Eve told she was afraid of Allah if she were to eat from His tree of Knowledge</li>
	<li>The serpent said she could eat the fruit from the tree of Knowledge without fear</li>
	<li>The serpent said the fruit would open her eyes and she would become as Allah</li>
	<li>And so she picked a fruit and ate and her eyes were opened</li>
	<li>She knew then of the Titans and their power over Allah</li>
	<li>She took a fruit from the tree to Adam and offered it to him</li>
	<li>And so they ate the fruit together</li>
	<li>And so their eyes became open</li>
	<li>And they knew then of the Gods</li>
	<li>And of Their power over Allah</li>
	<li>And they were not afraid</li>
	<li>When Allah walked through the garden, he found them eating the forbidden fruit</li>
	<li>Allah went to destroy Adam and his Eve as punishment, but Indus took them to Her mother Tethys</li>
	<li>Oceanus dismissed Adam and his Eve under the care of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates</li>
	<li>Saturn took pity on Adam and his Eve and brought food to the deserts around them</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did build a temple to the Gods and named it Eridu</li>
	<li>But Adam did confuse Saturn and Oceanus as the single Enki</li>
	<li>Saturn punished Adam by hiding the food under the sand</li>
	<li>Adam labored to bring the waters borne under Oceanus to the plants of Saturn to raise them above the sand</li>
	<li>Eve labored to gather the food from the plants and bring them to their hungry babes</li>
	<li>And so the Sons of Adam lived in a Silver Age for five hundred years.</li>

	<li>Saturn had with his sister Ops three Sons and three Daughters, the Olympians as follows: </li>
	<li>Goddess Juno would protect the women of the world</li>
	<li>Goddess Ceres would protect the grains of the lands</li>
	<li>Goddess Vesta would protect the homes of the people </li>
	<li>Hades was to be the new god of the underworld</li>
	<li>Neptune was to be the new god of the seas</li>
	<li>Jupiter was to be the new god of the skies above</li>
	<li>Saturn was fearful of their power and so ate them all</li>
	<li>Ops was able to save Her son Jupiter and sent him to the island of Crete</li>
	<li>She wrapped a stone in a cloth to give to Saturn in His place</li>
	<li>Five hundred years had passed before Jupiter returned to Greece</li>
	<li>With the help of Terra, Jupiter forced Saturn to regurgitate the Olympians</li>
	<li>Jupiter then attacked His father Saturn</li>
	<li>Thus the Titans and Olympians fought for ten years</li>
	<li>Terra told Jupiter that only with the help of the Cyclopes would He win</li>
	<li>And so Jupiter was able to force the Titans into Tartarus</li>
	<li>His brother Neptune took domain of the Sea</li>
	<li>His brother Pluto took domain of the Underworld</li>
	<li>Jupiter then took the domain of the Sky as King of the Gods</li>
	<li>Saturn was able to escape the might of Jupiter</li>
	<li>Janus in Latium welcomed Saturn with open arms and protection</li>
	<li>Saturn gave the righteous people of Latinium all the fruit of Terra without need to labor</li>
	<li>The people of Latinium lived in a Golden Age</li>
	<li>Jupiter shortened spring to create the seasons of summer, autumn, and winter</li>
	<li>Jupiter forced the people of the East to labor for the fruits of Terra</li>
	<li>The men of the East fought for the most fruitful of land</li>
	<li>And so the people of the East lived in a Bronze Age for five hundred year.</li>

	<li>Prometheus was now helper of Jupiter</li>
	<li>He did discover the Sons of Adam to the east, who did divide themselves into three groups</li>
	<li>The Sons of Abel, first son of Adam, had led their herds of cattle away to Africa</li>
	<li>The Sons of Cain, second son of Adam, had followed Cain north to Greece</li>
	<li>The Sons of Seth, third son of Adam, had built cities in the land of Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>Prometheus took fire from the Gods and gave it to Enmenluana, first son of Seth</li>
	<li>Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, took as His wife Pandora, a nomadic daughter of Cain</li>
	<li>As their wedding gift, Jupiter gave them a box that was never to be opened</li>
	<li>Driven by curiosity, Pandora took a peak in the box</li>
	<li>Out from the box came the evils of the world</li>
	<li>Illness, famine, and strife were until then unknown</li>
	<li>Modesty, truth, and loyalty were replaced with treachery, deceit, and greed</li>
	<li>Men fought for land, power, and wealth</li>
	<li>Friend betrayed friend, relative betrayed relative</li>
	<li>This caused much suffering and wickedness</li>
	<li>And so the people of the world lived in an Iron Age for five hundred years.</li>
</ol>

<section>
<ol>
	<li>Jupiter looked down upon the people of Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>He saw a world full of evil</li>
	<li>The wars of man threatened the domains of the Gods</li>
	<li>Giants did pile the mountains together to attack the heavens</li>
	<li>Jupiter struck them down with a bolt of thunder</li>
	<li>The Giants were crushed under the tumbling mountains</li>
	<li>From the blood of the Giants was born a new race of man who too had no respect for the Gods</li>
	<li>Jupiter saw that man was hopelessly violent</li>
	<li>Jupiter drew His thunderbolt to destroy all men on Terra</li>
	<li>Jupiter took a pause of restraint for a moment of thought</li>
	<li>The thunderbolt might destroy the domain of Gods</li>
	<li>So He ceased the North Wind and strengthened the South Wind to bring rain</li>
	<li>He called upon Neptune to raise the seas above all the lands</li>
	<li>All the fields and plains could not be cultivated</li>
	<li>All the animals and beasts on the land did drown</li>
	<li>All the birds tired of flight and fell into the sea</li>
	<li>Men too could not escape the tides</li>
	<li>And the waters prevailed upon the earth.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<ol>
	<li>Jupiter did notice a small boat aground atop Mount Parnassus</li>
	<li>Jupiter saw one man and one woman were the last to live</li>
	<li>Indeed they were virtuous people</li>
	<li>They prayed to the Gods above to save their lifes</li>
	<li>Jupiter released the North Wind to clear the storms and the clouds</li>
	<li>Neptune did call upon Triton to recall the tides</li>
	<li>Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha came down the mountain to the newly dry land</li>
	<li>They saw they were all whom were left</li>
	<li>They walked along the stream of Cephisus and asked the old oracle for guidance</li>
	<li>Justitia told them to go forth and throw behind them the bones of their great mother</li>
	<li>Both left in shock of the disgrace to the spirits of their mothers</li>
	<li>Then at last the son of Prometheus calmed the daughter of Epimetheus</li>
	<li>Pyrrha spoke in the ear of Deucalion:</li>
	<li>"Surely Terra is the Mother of all animals and men,</li>
	<li>"The hard rocks in the ground her bones,</li>
	<li>"Let us pick them up and give them a toss."</li>
	<li>So they each picked up rocks from the lines of the streams</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Deucalion did grow into men</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Pyrrha did grow into women</li>
	<li>And so in this way, the earth was repopulated by man</li>

	<li>Again the Sun above shined on the land below</li>
	<li>The moisture across the land warmed</li>
	<li>In continuous competition are fire and water</li>
	<li>But together humidity and warmth bring about life</li>
	<li>Seeds were sown to grow into plants</li>
	<li>Countless animals returned to the earth, some in ancestral form and some in weird and new</li>
	<li>Terra did also bring about a new serpent against Her will</li>
	<li>The giant Python threatened all the men of the world</li>
	<li>The Archer God Apollo struck down the beast</li>
	<li>Apollo did wish for Egypt to prosper</li>
	<li>And so He gave the remains to the people of Egypt, Sons of Abel, as the River Nile</li>
	<li>For five hundred years the people of Egypt owed their lifes to the River Nile</li>
	<li>Many men fought for control of the River</li>
	<li>It was Menes, Son of Helios, to unite all of Egypt</li>
	<li>And so was formed the Old Kingdom of Egypt</li>

	<li>Gilgamesh was the strongest man of the Sumerians, the Sons of Seth</li>
	<li>As king of the Sumerians, Gilgamesh held many festivals for himself in his palace</li>
	<li>The people of the city of Uruk prayed to the Gods</li>
	<li>The people of the city of Uruk proclaimed Gilgamesh to be a cruel king</li>
	<li>From the mountains came a man to rival the strength of Gilgamesh</li>
	<li>He ate grass with the gazelles and he jostled with the animals at the watering hole</li>
	<li>A trapper came across him as he set his traps</li>
	<li>He was afraid to approach the beast of man</li>
	<li>The trapper went to the city of Uruk and told Gilgamesh of the man</li>
	<li>"Go with a woman of the city to the watering hole,</li>
	<li>"She will open her arms to him,</li>
	<li>"The animals shall become alien to him"</li>
	<li>The trapper took a woman of the city to the watering hole</li>
	<li>On the third day the wild man did come</li>
	<li>The woman went to him and opened her arms</li>
	<li>They laid together and the animals ran to the mountains</li>
	<li>The woman gave him a cloth of hers</li>
	<li>He put it on and became a true man</li>
	<li>Together they returned to the city of Uruk</li>

	<li>Enkidu was a man from the mountains</li>
	<li>He had no mother nor a father</li>
	<li>A woman of the city brought him to Uruk and gave him bread and beer</li>
	<li>Enkidu became guard of all the herds of Uruk</li>
	<li>The herdsmen were thankful that they could rest at night</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh found Enkidu to be a trusty friend of all Sumerians</li>
	<li>To the west land of Canaan were cedar forests</li>
	<li>Protecting the forests was Humbaba</li>
	<li>"The roar of Humbaba is a flood,</li>
	<li>"His mouth is fire and his breath is death,</li>
	<li>"He can hear any rustling in his forests",</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh had been warned</li>
	<li>"Join me, Enkidu, to bring back cedar for the city,</li>
	<li>"And I shall be known for all eternity"</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh and Enkidu walked for six days and five nights</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh had many disturbing dreams of what was to come</li>
	<li>Enkidu thought they were favorable</li>
	<li>Together they stood</li>
	<li>Together they moved into the forests</li>
	<li>"A slippery path is not feared by two people who help each other"</li>
	<li>The guardian of the forests of Canaan did beg Gilgamesh for his life</li>
	<li>Enkidu asked Gilgamesh to ignore the begging</li>
	<li>He told Gilgamesh to destroy the monster Humbaba</li>
	<li>Humbaba pleaded with Enkidu, but Enkidu persisted</li>
	<li>"The city of Nippur will erect an eternal monument of how Gilgamesh killed the monster Humbaba"</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down all the trees of Canaan</li>
	<li>They faceted a raft to float down the river Euphrates</li>
	<li>Enkidu did steer as Gilgamesh held the head of Humbaba</li>

	<li>A daughter of Jupiter asked for Gilgamesh to take Her as his wife</li>
	<li>"Where is your beloved, colourful 'Little Shepherd' bird?</li>
	<li>"He stands in the forest crying 'My wing' that you hath broke,</li>
	<li>"You loved the stallion to whom you had ordained the whip and lash,</li>
	<li>"You loved the shepherd but sent him running from his dogs as a wolf,</li>
	<li>"It is I you love and you will ordain for me as for them"</li>
	<li>Venus ran to Her father Jupiter</li>
	<li>Jupiter gave to Her the Bull of Heaven</li>
	<li>The Bull did punish the people of the city of Uruk</li>
	<li>Enkidu grabbed the Bull by its horns as Gilgamesh cut his hindquarters</li>
	<li>Venus ran to Her father Jupiter</li>
	<li>"They must be slain" She requested</li>
	<li>Jupiter proclaimed that Gilgamesh was to live</li>
	<li>His friend Enkidu was to be brought to death</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh mourned the death of his friend</li>

	<li>"The time of death cannot be known to any man"</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh asked to not return to the city of Uruk with nothing to show of his journey</li>
	<li>A daughter of Hades gave to him a plant of immortality</li>
	<li>As Gilgamesh returned to the city of Uruk he did fall asleep</li>
	<li>A serpent quietly took the plant away</li>
	<li>Gilgamesh wept in his hands</li>
	<li>"I will have the misfortune to die in the near future,</li>
	<li>"For I have nothing to show for my journey to the Gates of Hades"</li>
	<li>When he arrived in Uruk he climbed the city walls</li>
	<li>He looked out across the city</li>
	<li>He looked out across the palm gardens</li>
	<li>He looked out across the open lowlands</li>
	<li>He looked out across Uruk the walls enclosed</li>

	<li>The Gods led the noblemen to revolt</li>
	<li>Egypt fell into anarchy</li>
	<li>Noblemen had to cultivate land to survive</li>
	<li>Relative turned against relative</li>
	<li>To resolve the fighting, Helios gave half of Egypt to each His two sons</li>
	<li>Order was restored within their separate realms</li>
	<li>Each half grew jealous of the other</li>
	<li>War between the Upper and Lower Egypts erupted in time</li>
	<li>Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt</li>
	<li>Peace was restored to all of Egypt</li>
	<li>Pharaohs again had control</li>

	<li>The Sons of Eber, as a Son of Seth, were under the care of Allah</li>
	<li>These Hebrews were led by Abram, son of Terah, son of Nahor</li>
	<li>Nahor was grandson of Reu, grandson of Eber</li>
	<li>Eber was grandson of Arpachshad, grandson of Noah</li>
	<li>Noah was grandson of Methuselah, grandson of Jared</li>
	<li>Jared was grandson of Kenan, grandson of Seth</li>
	<li>Allah threatened Abram and had the Hebrews worship no other Gods but Himself</li>
	<li>The Sons of Abram did take heed of His words</li>
	<li>The Sons of Asshur, grandson of Noah, lived now in Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>These Assyrians continued to worship the Gods from the tradition of the Sumerians </li>
	<li>There was much fighting between the Hebrews and the Assyrians</li>
	<li>Allah promised the Hebrews more fertile land to the west, in the land of Canaan</li>
	<li>Abram instead found the land to be under a drought</li>
	<li>He lead the Hebrews to the shores of Egypt</li>
	<li>The Pharaohs of Egypt were cruel leaders</li>
	<li>Abram did lead the Hebrews from Egypt to return to Canaan</li>
	<li>Allah did promise a child to the aged Abram and his bare wife Sarai</li>
	<li>Abram could not wait for the promise of Allah to be fulfilled</li>
	<li>Abram did conceive a son with the maidservant of Sarai</li>
	<li>Sarai named the newborn boy Ishmael</li>
	<li>Abram agreed with Allah to have all sons of him to be circumcised</li>
	<li>Allah praised Abram and made many promises to him</li>
	<li>Abram changed his name to Abraham and Sarai changed her name to Sarah</li>
	<li>Years later, Abraham did conceive a son with Sarah</li>
	<li>Sarah named the newborn boy Isaac, son of Abraham</li>
	<li>Sarah did protest to having the son of Abraham and her maidservant with them</li>
	<li>Abraham did send the maidservant and her son Ishmael to wander the deserts of Arabia</li>
	<li>Allah decreed that Ishmael would be father of kings as son of Abraham</li>
	<li>Allah decreed that Isaac was to be father of kings as son of Abraham</li>
	<li>The Canaanites, as Sons of Cain, near Abraham did offer many children to the Gods</li>
	<li>Allah asked Abraham for his only son Isaac</li>
	<li>Abraham and Isaac did agree</li>
	<li>Abraham was to thrust a blade into the chest of Isaac</li>
	<li>Allah did stop him and proclaimed it a test</li>
	<li>Allah, nor any God, wishes to see any man die at knife-edge</li>
	<li>Abraham feared the wrath of Allah</li>
	<li>And so the land of Canaan was to always belong to the Sons of Isaac, son of Abraham</li>
