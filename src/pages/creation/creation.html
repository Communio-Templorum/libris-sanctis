	<ruby>Before the sea and the earth, and the sky which covers all

	<ruby>and there was nothing but this inert weight

	<ruby>not well joined, the discordant seeds of things.

	<ruby>nor was there land or sea or air.

	<ruby>In one body there was cold conflicting against heat, wet against dry, soft against hard,

	<ruby>and that with weight conflicting against that without weight.

	<ruby>Chaos broke apart this strife.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">Hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit.</ruby>
	<ruby>He separated the lands from the sea and the liquid apart from the air.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">nam caelo terras et terris abscidit undas et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere caelum.</ruby>
	<ruby>That which He had disengaged and extricated from the blind heap, He bound disjoined in their places in concordant peace:

	<ruby>When He had divided the heap thus arranged, He had reduced it divided into members:

	<ruby>First He collected the land into the form of a great globe, lest it might not be equal in every part.

	<ruby>He ordered the seas to be poured abroad and to swell with the rapid winds and to surround the shores of the compassed earth.

	<ruby>He added also fountains, and immense pools and lakes;

	<ruby>And He girt with sloping banks the descending rivers, which, different in their places, are partially absorbed by the earth itself,

	<ruby>and others arrive into the seas and, being received in the plain of freer water, beat shores instead of banks.
		<rtc lang="la" translate="no">in mare perveniunt partim campoque recepta liberioris aquae pro ripis litora pulsant.</ruby>
	<ruby>He ordered also plains to be stretch out, valleys to sink down, woods to be covered with foliage, and stoney mountains to rise.

	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to three beasts Centimani</li>
	<li>The three were born with hundred hands and fifty heads</li>
	<li>Allah was unable to lay his eyes upon the three and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to three giants Cyclopes</li>
	<li>The three were born with a single eye and great fury</li>
	<li>Allah was fearful of their strength and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>After five hundred years, Terra gave birth to six gods and six goddesses</li>
	<li>They came to this world in the image of the Father and the Mother</li>
	<li>Allah though feared their power and so cast them to Tartarus</li>
	<li>Terra would weep and Allah would ignore her cries</li>
	<li>And so the world would sit barren for five hundred years</li>
</ol>

	<li>Father Allah and Mother Terra had six Daughters and six Sons, the Titans as follows:</li>
	<li>Oceanus god of the wild sea, Tethys goddess of the seas, and their children, the Oceanid nymphs of the water sources;</li>
	<li>Polus god of intellect, goddess Phoebe, and their children Leto and Asteria;</li>
	<li>Hyperion god of observation, Theia goddess of sight, and their children Helios, Luna, and Aurora;</li>
	<li>The gods Iapetus and Crius;</li>
	<li>Mnemosyne goddess of memory; Justitia goddess of divine order;</li>
	<li>and then Saturn god of agriculture and His wife Ops goddess of the harvest.</li>
	<li>Allah feared the power of the Titans and so locked them in the underworld of Tartarus</li>
	<li>This did cause Terra much discomfort</li>
	<li>Terra built a sickle and offered it to each of her sons</li>
	<li>Only Saturn did take the sickle and hide by Allah's bed</li>
	<li>As Allah went to lay with Terra, Saturn used the sickle to castrate Allah</li>
	<li>Allah screamed in pain and fought back</li>
	<li>Saturn overpowered Allah but Justitia held His held before the final blow</li>
	<li>Saturn freed the Titans and ruled as King</li>
	<li>Saturn had His brother Oceanus form the seas and His sister Tethys form the rivers</li>
	<li>Saturn created the plants with His sister Ops</li>
	<li>Saturn had Epimetheus, Son of Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene, create the animals of the world</li>
	<li>Saturn had Prometheus, Son of Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene, create man in His image</li>
	<li>All were living in peace as Terra gave her fruits without cultivation or labor</li>
	<li>And so the world was in a Golden Age for five hundred years.</li>

	<li>The Titans sat and decided together that Allah may live, but not with them</li>
	<li>Allah ran east to the river Indus</li>
	<li>He soon found a man and a woman in a garden serene</li>
	<li>They ate amongst the trees naked without strife</li>
	<li>Allah came to walk with Adam and his Eve</li>
	<li>Allah watched over the couple and protected them</li>
	<li>He set down a tree of Knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>Allah told His Adam and Eve not to eat from His tree</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did agree</li>
	<li>When Allah was away, the serpent of Lucifer, Son of Aurora, went to talk to Eve</li>
	<li>Eve told she was afraid of Allah if she were to eat from His tree of Knowledge</li>
	<li>The serpent said she could eat the fruit from the tree of Knowledge without fear</li>
	<li>The serpent said the fruit would open her eyes and she would become as Allah</li>
	<li>And so she picked a fruit and ate and her eyes were opened</li>
	<li>She knew then of the Titans and their power over Allah</li>
	<li>She took a fruit from the tree to Adam and offered it to him</li>
	<li>And so they ate the fruit together</li>
	<li>And so their eyes became open</li>
	<li>And they knew then of the Gods</li>
	<li>And of Their power over Allah</li>
	<li>And they were not afraid</li>
	<li>When Allah walked through the garden, he found them eating the forbidden fruit</li>
	<li>Allah went to destroy Adam and his Eve as punishment, but Indus took them to Her mother Tethys</li>
	<li>Oceanus dismissed Adam and his Eve under the care of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates</li>
	<li>Saturn took pity on Adam and his Eve and brought food to the deserts around them</li>
	<li>Adam and his Eve did build a temple to the Gods and named it Eridu</li>
	<li>But Adam did confuse Saturn and Oceanus as the single Enki</li>
	<li>Saturn punished Adam by hiding the food under the sand</li>
	<li>Adam labored to bring the waters borne under Oceanus to the plants of Saturn to raise them above the sand</li>
	<li>Eve labored to gather the food from the plants and bring them to their hungry babes</li>
	<li>And so the Sons of Adam lived in a Silver Age for five hundred years.</li>

	<li>Prometheus was now helper of Saturn</li>
	<li>He did discover the Sons of Adam in Mesopotamia, who did divide themselves into three groups</li>
	<li>The Sons of Abel, first son of Adam, had led their herds of cattle away to Africa</li>
	<li>The Sons of Cain, second son of Adam, had followed Cain north to Greece</li>
	<li>The Sons of Seth, third son of Adam, had built cities in the land of Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>Prometheus took fire from the Gods and gave it to Enmenluana, first son of Seth</li>
	<li>Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, took as His wife Pandora, a nomadic daughter of Cain</li>
	<li>As their wedding gift, Saturn gave them a box that was never to be opened</li>
	<li>Driven by curiosity, Pandora took a peak in the box</li>
	<li>Out from the box came the evils of the world</li>
	<li>Illness, famine, and strife were until then unknown</li>
	<li>Modesty, truth, and loyalty were replaced with treachery, deceit, and greed</li>
	<li>Men fought for land, power, and wealth</li>
	<li>Friend betrayed friend, relative betrayed relative</li>
	<li>This caused much suffering and wickedness</li>
	<li>And so the people of the world lived in an Iron Age for five hundred years.</li>

	<li>Saturn looked down upon the people of Mesopotamia</li>
	<li>He saw a land full of evil and war</li>
	<li>The wars of man threatened the domains of the Gods</li>
	<li>Giants did pile the mountains together to attack the heavens</li>
	<li>Saturn struck them down with a bolt of thunder</li>
	<li>The Giants were crushed under the tumbling mountains</li>
	<li>From the blood of the Giants was born a new race of man who too had no respect for the Gods</li>
	<li>Saturn saw that man was hopelessly violent</li>
	<li>So He ceased the North Wind and strengthened the South Wind to bring rain</li>
	<li>He called upon Oceanus to raise the seas above all the lands.</li>
	<li>All the fields and plains could not be cultivated</li>
	<li>All the animals and beasts on the land did drown</li>
	<li>All the birds tired of flight and fell into the sea</li>
	<li>Men too could not escape the tides</li>
	<li>And the waters prevailed upon the earth.</li>

	<li>Saturn did notice a small boat aground atop Mount Parnassus</li>
	<li>Saturn saw one man and one woman were the last to live</li>
	<li>Indeed they were virtuous people</li>
	<li>They prayed to the Gods above to save their lifes</li>
	<li>Saturn released the North Wind to clear the storms and the clouds</li>
	<li>Oceanus did call upon Triton to recall the tides</li>
	<li>Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha came down the mountain to the newly dry land</li>
	<li>They saw they were all whom were left</li>
	<li>They walked along the stream of Cephisus and asked the old oracle for guidance</li>
	<li>Justitia told them to go forth and throw behind them the bones of their great mother</li>
	<li>Both left in shock of the disgrace to the spirits of their mothers</li>
	<li>Then at last the son of Prometheus calmed the daughter of Epimetheus</li>
	<li>Pyrrha spoke in the ear of Deucalion:</li>
	<li>"Surely Terra is the Mother of all animals and men,</li>
	<li>"The hard rocks in the ground her bones,</li>
	<li>"Let us pick them up and give them a toss."</li>
	<li>So they each picked up rocks from the lines of the streams</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Deucalion did grow into men</li>
	<li>Each rock from the hand of Pyrrha did grow into women</li>
	<li>And so in this way, the earth was repopulated by man</li>
