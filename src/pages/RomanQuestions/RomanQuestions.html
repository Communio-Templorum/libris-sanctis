<h3 itemprop="name">Why do they bid the bride touch fire and water?</h3>
<p>Is it that of these two, being reckoned as elements or first principles, fire is masculine and water feminine,<a id="ref-1-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> and fire supplies the beginnings of motion and water the function of the subsistent element or the material?</p>
<p>Or is it because fire purifies and water cleanses, and a married woman must remain pure and clean?</p>
<p>Or is it that, just as fire without moisture is unsustaining and arid, and water without heat is unproductive and inactive,<a id="ref-1-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> so also male and female apart from each other are inert, but their union in marriage produces the perfection of their life together?</p>
<p>Or is it that they must not desert each other, but must share together every sort of fortune, even if they are destined to have nothing other than fire and water to share with each other?</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why in the marriage rites do they light five torches, neither more nor less, which they call cereones?</h3>
<p>Is it, as Varro has stated, that while the praetors use three, the aediles have a right<a id="ref-2-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> to more, and it is from the aediles that the wedding party light their torches?</p>
<p>Or is it because in their use of several numbers the odd number was considered better and more perfect for various purposes and also better adapted to marriage? For the even number admits division and its equality of division suggests strife and opposition; the odd number, however, cannot be divided into equal parts at all, but whenever it is divided it always leaves behind a remainder of the same nature as itself. Now, of the odd numbers, five is above all the nuptial number; for three is the first odd number, and two is the first even number, and five is composed of the union of these two, as it were of male and female.<a id="ref-2-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a></p>
<p>Or is it rather that, since light is the symbol of birth, and women in general are enabled by nature to bear, at the most, five children at one birth,<a id="ref-2-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> the wedding company makes use of exactly that number of torches?</p>
<p>Or is it because they think that the nuptial pair has need of five deities: Zeus Teleios, Hera Teleia, Aphrodite, Peitho, and finally Artemis, whom women in child-birth and travail are wont to invoke?</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why is it that, although there are many shrines of Diana in Rome, the only one into which men may not enter is the shrine in the so-called Vicus Patricius?</h3>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do they, as might be expected, nail up stags’ horns in all the other shrines of Diana, but in the shrine on the Aventine nail up horns of cattle?</h3>
<p>Is it because they remember the ancient occurrence?<a id="ref-4-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> For the tale is told that among the Sabines in the herds of Antro Curiatius was born a heifer excelling all the others in appearance and size. When a certain soothsayer told him that the city of the man who should sacrifice that heifer to Diana on the Aventine was destined to become the mightiest city and to rule all Italy, the man came to Rome with intent to sacrifice his heifer. But a servant of his secretly told the prophecy to the king Servius, who told Cornelius the priest, and Cornelius gave instructions to Antro to bathe in the Tiber before the sacrifice; for this, said he, was the custom of those whose sacrifice was to be acceptable. Accordingly Antro went away and bathed, but Servius sacrificed the heifer to Diana before Antro could return, and nailed the horns to the shrine. This tale both Juba<a id="ref-4-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> and Varro have recorded, except that Varro has not noted the name of Antro; and he says that the Sabine was cozened, not by Cornelius the priest, but by the keeper of the temple.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why is it that those who are falsely reported to have died in a foreign country, even if they return, men do not admit by the door, but mount upon the roof-tiles and let them down inside?</h3>
<p>Varro gives an explanation of the cause that is quite fabulous. For he says that in the Sicilian war there was a great naval battle, and in the case of many men a false report spread that they were dead. But, when they had returned home, in a short time they all came to their end except one who, when he tried to enter, found the doors shutting against him of their own accord, nor did they yield when he strove to open them. The man fell asleep there before his threshold and in his sleep saw a vision, which instructed him to climb upon the roof and let himself down into the house. When he had done so, he prospered and lived to an advanced age; and from this occurrence the custom became established for succeeding generations.</p>
<p>But consider if this be not in some wise similar to Greek customs; for the Greeks did not consider pure, nor admit to familiar intercourse, nor suffer to approach the temples any person for whom a funeral had been held and a tomb constructed on the assumption that they were dead. The tale is told that Aristinus, a victim of this superstition, sent to Delphi and besought the god to release him from the difficulties in which he was involved because of the custom; and the prophetic priestess gave response:</p>
<blockquote>All that a woman in childbed does at the birth of her baby,<br>
When this again thou hast done, to the blessed gods sacrifice offer.</blockquote>
<p>Aristinus, accordingly, chose the part of wisdom and delivered himself like a new-born babe into the hands of women to be washed, and to be wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and to be suckled; and all other men in such plight do likewise and they are called "Men of Later Fate." But some will have it that this was done in the case of such persons even before Aristinus, and that the custom is ancient. Hence it is nothing surprising if the Romans also did not think it right to admit by the door, through which they go out to sacrifice and come in from sacrificing, those who are thought to have been buried once and for all and to belong to the company of the departed, but bade them descend from the open air above into that portion of the house which is exposed to the sky. And with good reason, for, naturally, they perform all their rites of purification under the open sky.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do the women kiss their kinsmen on the lips?</h3>
<p>Is it, as most authorities believe, that the drinking of wine was forbidden to women,<a id="ref-6-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> and therefore, so that women who had drunk wine should not escape detection, but should be detected when they chanced to meet men of their household, the custom of kissing was established?</p>
<p>Or is it for the reason which Aristotle<a id="ref-6-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> the philosopher has recorded? For that far-famed deed, the scene of which is laid in many different places,<a id="ref-6-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> was dared, it appears, by the Trojan women, even on the very shores of Italy. For when they had reached the coast, and the men had disembarked, the women set fire to the ships, since, at all hazards, they desired to be quit of their wanderings and their sea-faring. But they were afraid of their husbands, and greeted with a kiss and a warm embrace such of their kinsmen and members of their household as they encountered; and when the men had ceased from their wrath and had become reconciled, the women continued thereafter as well to employ this mark of affection towards them.</p>
<p>Or was this rather bestowed upon the women as a privilege that should bring them both honour and power if they should be seen to have many good men among their kinsmen and in their household?</p>
<p>Or is it that, since it is not the custom for men to marry blood relations, <a id="ref-6-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> affection proceeded only so far as a kiss, and this alone remained as a token of kinship and a participation therein? For formerly men did not marry women related to them by ties of blood, just as even now they do not marry their aunts or their sisters <a id="ref-6-e" role="doc-noteref">e</a>; but after a long time they made the concession of allowing wedlock with cousins for the following reason: a man possessed of no property, but otherwise of excellent character and more satisfactory to the people than other public men, had as wife his cousin, an heiress, and was thought to be growing rich from her estate. He was accused on this ground, but the people would not even try the case and dismissed the charge, enacting a decree that all might marry cousins or more distant relatives; but marriage with nearer kin was prohibited.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why is it forbidden for a man to receive a gift from his wife or a wife to receive a gift from her husband?<a id="ref-7-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a></h3>
<p>Is it that, Solon having promulgated a law<a id="ref-7-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> that the bequests of the deceased should be valid unless a man were constrained by force or persuaded by his wife, whereby he excepted force as overriding the free will, and pleasure as misleading the judgement, in this way the bequests of wives and husbands became suspect?</p>
<p>Or did they regard giving as an utterly worthless token of affection (for even strangers and persons with no kindly feelings give gifts), and so deprived the marriage relationship of this mode of giving pleasure, that mutual affection might be unbought and free, existing for its own sake and for no other reason?</p>
<p>Or is it that women are most likely to be seduced and welcome strangers because of gifts they receive from them; and thus it is seen to be dignified for them to love their own husbands even though their husbands give them no gifts?</p>
<p>Or is it rather that both the husbands’ property should be held in common with their wives and the wives’ with their husbands? For anyone who accepts what is given learns to regard what is not given to him as belonging to another, with the result that by giving a little to each other they deprive each other of all else that they own.</p>

<p>Is it because this is the mark of a man who is confident that his wife is not up to any mischief, whereas coming suddenly and unexpectedly is, as it were, an arrival by stratagem and unfair vigilance; and are they eager to send good tidings about themselves to their wives as if they felt certain that their wives would be longing for them and expecting them?</p>
<p>Or is it rather that the men themselves long to hear news of their wives, if they shall find them safe at home and longing for their husbands?</p>
<p>Or is it because during their husbands’ absence the wives have more household duties and occupations, and also dissensions and outbursts against those of the household? Therefore the notice is given in advance that the wife may rid herself of these matters and make for her husband his welcome home undisturbed and pleasant.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why is it that when they worship the gods, they cover their heads, but when they meet any of their fellow-men worthy of honour, if they happen to have the toga over the head, they uncover?<a id="ref-10-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a></h3>
<p>This second fact seems to intensify the difficulty of the first. If, then, the tale told of Aeneas<a id="ref-10-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> is true, that, when Diomedes passed by, he covered his head and completed the sacrifice, it is reasonable and consistent with the covering of one's head in the presence of an enemy that men who meet good men and their friends should uncover. In fact, the behaviour in regard to the gods is not properly related to this custom, but accidentally resembles it; and its observance has persisted since the days of Aeneas.</p>
<p>But if there is anything else to be said, consider whether it be not true that there is only one matter that needs investigation: why men cover their heads when they worship the gods; and the other follows from this. For they uncover their heads in the presence of men more influential than they: it is not to invest these men with additional honour, but rather to avert from them the jealousy of the gods, that these men may not seem to demand the same honours as the gods, nor to tolerate an attention like that bestowed on the gods, nor to rejoice therein. But they thus worshipped the gods, either humbling themselves by concealing the head, or rather by pulling the toga over their ears as a precaution lest any ill-omened and baleful sound from without should reach them while they were praying. That they were mightily vigilant in this matter is obvious from the fact that when they went forth for purposes of divination, they surrounded themselves with the clashing of bronze.</p>
<p>Or, as Castor<a id="ref-10-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> states when he is trying to bring Roman customs into relation with Pythagorean doctrines: the Spirit within us entreats and supplicates the gods without, and thus he symbolizes by the covering of the head the covering and concealment of the soul by the body.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do sons cover their heads when they escort their parents to the grave, while daughters go with uncovered heads and hair unbound?</h3>
<p>Is it because fathers should be honoured as gods by their male offspring, but mourned as dead by their daughters, that custom has assigned to each sex its proper part and has produced a fitting result from both?</p>
<p>Or is it that the unusual is proper in mourning, and it is more usual for women to go forth in public with their heads covered and men with their heads uncovered? So in Greece, whenever any misfortune comes, the women cut off their hair and the men let it grow, for it is usual for men to have their hair cut and for women to let it grow.</p>
<p>Or is it that it has become customary for sons to cover their heads for the reason already given?<a id="ref-14-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> For they turn about at the graves, as Varro relates, thus honouring the tombs of their fathers even as they do the shrines of the gods; and when they have cremated their parents, they declare that the dead person has become a god at the moment when first they find a bone.<a id="ref-14-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a></p>
<p>But formerly women were not allowed to cover the head at all. At least it is recorded that Spurius Carvilius<a id="ref-14-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> was the first man to divorce his wife and the reason was her barrenness; the second was Sulpicius Gallus, because he saw his wife pull her cloak over her head; and the third was Publius Sempronius, because his wife had been present as a spectator at funeral games.<a id="ref-14-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a></p>

<p>The fact is that, in ancient days, March was counted before January, as is clear from many different proofs, and particularly from the fact that the fifth month from March is called Quintilis, the sixth Sextilis, and so on to the last, which they call December, since it is the tenth in order from March. Wherefore it has also naturally occurred to some to believe and to maintain that the ancient Romans completed their year, not in twelve months, but in ten, by adding more days than thirty to some of the months. Others state that December is the tenth from March, January the eleventh, and February the twelfth; and in this month they perform rites of purification and make offerings to the dead, since it is the end of the year. But the order of these months was altered, so they say, and January was put first because in this month on the day of the new moon, which they call the Kalends of January, the first consuls entered office after the kings had been expelled.</p>
<p>But more worthy of credence are they who maintain that it was because Romulus was a warrior and a lover of battle, and was thought to be a son of Mars, that he placed first the month which bore Mars’ name. But Numa, in turn, who was a lover of peace, and whose ambition it was to turn the city towards husbandry and to divert it from war, gave the precedence to January and advanced the god Janus to great honours, since Janus<a id="ref-19-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> was a statesman and a husbandman rather than a warrior. But consider whether Numa may not have adopted as the beginning of the year that which conforms to our conception of the natural beginning. Speaking generally, to be sure, there is not naturally either last or first in a cycle; and it is by custom that some adopt one beginning of this period and others another. They do best, however, who adopt the beginning after the winter solstice, when the sun has ceased to advance, and turns about and retraces his course toward us. For this beginning of the year is in a certain way natural to mankind, since it increases the amount of light that we receive and decreases the amount of darkness, and brings nearer to us the lord and leader of all mobile matter.</p>

<p>Was this goddess, as the mythologists relate, the wife of the seer Faunus; and was she secretly addicted to wine,<a id="ref-20-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> but did not escape detection and was beaten by her husband with myrtle rods, and is this the reason why they do not bring in myrtle and, when they make libations of wine to her, call it milk?</p>
<p>Or is it because they remain pure from many things, particularly from venery, when they perform this holy service? For they not only exclude their husbands, but they also drive everything male out of the house<a id="ref-20-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> whenever they conduct the customary ceremonies in honour of the goddess. So, because the myrtle is sacred to Venus, they religiously exclude it. For she whom they now call Venus Murcia, in ancient days, it seems, they styled Myrtia.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why have they in the month three beginnings or fixed points, and do not adopt the same interval of days between them?</h3>
<p>Is it, as Juba<a id="ref-24-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> and his followers relate, that on the Kalends the officials used to call<a id="ref-24-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> the people and announce the Nones for the fifth day thereafter, regarding the Ides as a holy day?</p>
<p>Or is it rather because, since they measured time by the phases of the moon, they observed that in each month the moon undergoes three very important changes: first, when she is hidden by her conjunction with the sun; second, when she has escaped the sun's rays and becomes visible for the first time at sunset; and third, at the full moon, when her orb is completely round? The disappearance and concealment of the moon they call Kalendae, for everything concealed or secret is <i lang="la" translate="no">clam</i>, and "to be concealed" is <i lang="la" translate="no">celari</i>.<a id="ref-24-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> The first appearance of the moon they call Nones, the most accurate since it is the new moon: for their word for "new" and "novel" is the same as ours.<a id="ref-24-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> They name the Ides as they do either because of the beauty and form (<i lang="la" translate="no">eidos</i>) of the full-orbed moon, or by derivation from a title of Jupiter.<a id="ref-24-e" role="doc-noteref">e</a> But we must not follow out the most exact calculation of the number of days nor cast aspersions on approximate reckoning; since even now, when astronomy has made so much progress, the irregularity of the moon's movements is still beyond the skill of mathematicians, and continues to elude their calculations.<a id="ref-24-f" role="doc-noteref">f</a></p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do they reckon the day that follows the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides as unsuitable for leaving home or for travel?</h3>
<p>Is it, as most authorities think and as Livy<a id="ref-25-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> records, that on the day after the Ides of Quintilis, which they now call July, the military tribunes led out the army, and were vanquished in battle by the Gauls at the river Allia and lost the City? But when the day after the Ides had come to be regarded as ill-omened, did superstition, as is its wont, extend the custom further, and involve in the same circumspection the day after the Nones and the day after the Kalends?</p>
<p>Or does this contain many irrational assumptions? For it was on a different day that they were defeated in battle,<a id="ref-25-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> a day which they call Alliensis from the river, and make a dread day of expiation<a id="ref-25-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a>; and although they have many ill-omened days, they do not observe them under the same names<a id="ref-25-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> in each month, but each in the month in which it occurs; and it is thus quite incredible that the superstition should have attached itself simply to all the days that follow immediately after the Nones or the Kalends.</p>
<p>Consider the following analogy: just as they have dedicated the first month to the gods of Olympus, and the second, in which they perform certain rites of purification and sacrifice to the departed, to the gods of the lower world, so also in regard to the days of the month they have established three as festive and holy days, as I have stated,<a id="ref-25-e" role="doc-noteref">e</a> which are, as it were, fundamental and sovereign days; but the days which follow immediately they have dedicated to the spirits and the dead, and have come to regard them as ill-omened and unsuitable for business. In fact, the Greeks worship the gods on the day of the new moon; the next day they have duly assigned to the heroes and spirits, and the second bowl of wine is mixed in honour of the heroes and heroines.<a id="ref-25-f" role="doc-noteref">f</a> And speaking generally, time is a sort of number; and the beginning of number is divine, for it is the monad. But after it is the dyad, antagonistic to the beginning number, and the first of the even numbers. The even numbers are imperfect, incomplete, and indeterminate, just as the odd numbers are determinate, completing, and perfect.<a id="ref-25-g" role="doc-noteref">g</a> Wherefore, in like manner, the Nones succeed the Kalends at an interval of five days and the Ides succeed the Nones at an interval of nine days. For the odd numbers define the beginnings, but the even numbers, since they occur after the beginnings, have no position nor power; therefore on these days they do not begin any business or travel.</p>
<p>Or has also the saying of Themistocles<a id="ref-25-h" role="doc-noteref">h</a> some foundation in reason? For once upon a time, said he, the Day-After had an altercation with the Feast-Day on the ground that the Feast-Day had much labour and toil, whereas she herself provided the opportunity of enjoying in leisure and quiet all the things prepared for the festival. To this the Feast-Day replied, "You are quite right; but if I had not been, you would not be!" This story Themistocles related to the Athenian generals who succeeded him, to show that they would have been nowhere, if he himself had not saved the city.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, all travel and all business of importance needs provision and preparation, and since in ancient days the Romans, at the time of festivals, made no provision or plan for anything, save only that they were engaged in the service of their gods and busied themselves with this only, just as even to this day the priests cause such a proclamation to be made in advance as they proceed on their way to sacrifice; so it was only natural that they did not set out on a journey immediately after their festivals, nor did they transact any business, for they were unprepared; but that day they always spent at home making their plans and preparations.</p>
<p>Or is it even as men now, who have offered their prayers and oblations, are wont to tarry and sit a while in the temples,<a id="ref-25-i" role="doc-noteref">i</a> and so they would not let busy days succeed holy days immediately, but made some pause and breathing-space between, since business brings with it much that is distasteful and undesired?</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do women in mourning wear white robes and white head-dresses?</h3>
<p>Do they do this, as men say the Magi do, arraying themselves against Hades and the powers of darkness, and making themselves like unto Light and Brightness?</p>
<p>Or is it that, just as they clothe the body of the dead in white, they think it proper that the relatives should also wear this colour? They adorn the body thus since they cannot so adorn the soul; and they wish to send forth the soul bright and pure, since it is now set free after having fought the good fight in all its manifold forms.</p>
<p>Or are plainness and simplicity most becoming on these occasions? Of the dyed garments, some reflect expense, others over-elaboration; for we may say no less with reference to black than to purple: "These be cheating garments, these be cheating colours."<a id="ref-26-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> That which is naturally black is dyed not through art, but by nature; and when it is

To protect their enterprise and to prevent anyone from approaching and trying to wrest the maiden from them, they shouted continually that she was being brought as a wife for Talasius (Talasio). Since, therefore, everyone honoured Talasius, they followed along and provided escort, joining in the good wishes and acclamations. Wherefore since Talasius's marriage was happy, they became accustomed to invoke Talasius in other marriages also, even as the Greeks invoke Hymen.</p>

<p>Is it because in ancient days the barbarians who lived in these parts used to destroy thus the Greeks whom they captured? But Hercules, who was much admired by them, put an end to their murder of strangers and taught them to throw figures into the river, in imitation of their superstitious custom. The men of old used to call all Greeks alike Argives; unless it be, indeed, since the Arcadians regarded the Argives also as their enemies because of their immediate proximity, that, when Evander and his men<a id="ref-32-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> fled from Greece and settled here, they continued to preserve their ancient feud and enmity.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">And why do they thus honour Larentia who was at one time a courtesan?</h3>
<p>They record that there was another Larentia, Acca,<a id="ref-35-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> the nurse of Romulus, whom they honour in the month of April. But they say that the surname of the courtesan Larentia was Fabula. She became famous for the following reason<a id="ref-35-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a>: a certain keeper of the temple of Hercules enjoyed, it seems, considerable leisure and had the habit of spending the greater part of the day at draughts and dice; and one day, as it chanced, there was present no one of those who were wont to play with him and share the occupation of his leisure. So, in his boredom, he challenged the god to throw dice with him on fixed terms, as it were: if he should win, he was to obtain some service from the god; but if he should lose, he was to furnish a supper for the god at his own expense and provide a comely girl to spend the night with him. Thereupon he brought out the dice, and threw once for himself and once for the god, and lost. Abiding, therefore, by the terms of his challenge he prepared a somewhat sumptuous repast for the god and fetched Larentia, who openly practised the profession of courtesan. He feasted her, put her to bed in the temple, and, when he departed, locked the doors. The tale is told that the god visited her in the night, not in mortal wise, and bade her on the morrow go into the forum, and pay particular attention to the first man she met, and make him her friend. Larentia arose, therefore, and, going forth, met one of the wealthy men that were unwed and past their prime, whose name was Tarrutius. With this man she became acquainted, and while he lived she presided over his household, and when he died, she inherited his estate; and later, when she herself died, she left her property to the State; and for that reason she has these honours.</p>

<p>Or is it because we should observe birds when they are in their prime and in perfect condition?

<h3 itemprop="name">Why were men who were not regularly enlisted, but merely tarrying in the camp, not allowed to throw missiles at the enemy or to wound them?</h3>
<p>This fact Cato the Elder<a id="ref-39-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> has made clear in one of his letters to his son, in which he bids the young man to return home if he has completed his term of service and has been discharged; or, if he should stay over, to obtain permission from his general to wound or slay an enemy.</p>
<p>Is it because sheer necessity alone constitutes a warrant to kill a human being, and he who does so illegally and without the word of command is a murderer? For this reason Cyrus also praised Chrysantas<a id="ref-39-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> who, when he was about to kill an enemy, and had his weapon raised to strike, heard the recall sounded and let the man go without striking him, believing that he was now prevented from so doing.</p>
<p>Or must he who grapples with the enemy and fights not be free from accountability nor go unscathed should he play the coward? For he does not help so much by hitting or wounding an enemy as he does harm by fleeing or retreating. He, therefore, who has been discharged from service is freed from military regulations; but he who asks leave to perform the offices of a soldier renders himself again accountable to the regulations and to his general.</p>

<p>Is it because it used not to be proper or decent for sons to strip in their father's sight, nor a son-in-law in the presence of his father-in-law, nor in ancient days did they bathe together?<a id="ref-40-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> Now Jupiter is our father, and whatever is in the open air is in some way thought to be particularly in his sight.</p>
<p>Or, just as it is against divine ordinance to strip oneself in a shrine or a temple, so also did they scrupulously avoid the open air and the space beneath the heavens, since it was full of gods and spirits? Wherefore also we perform many necessary acts under a roof, hidden and concealed by our houses from the view of Divine powers.</p>
<p>Or are some regulations prescribed for the priest alone, while others are prescribed for all by the law through the priest? Wherefore also, in my country, to wear a garland, to wear the hair long, not to have any iron on one's person, and not to set foot within the boundaries of Phocis, are the special functions of an archon; but not to taste fruit before the autumnal equinox nor to prune a vine before the vernal equinox are prohibitions disclosed to practically all alike through the archon; for those are the proper seasons for each of these acts.</p>
<p>In the same way, then, it is apparently a special obligation of the Roman priest also not to use a horse nor to be absent from the city more than three nights<a id="ref-40-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> nor to lay aside the cap from which he derives the name of, <i lang="la" translate="no">flamen</i>.<a id="ref-40-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> But many other regulations are revealed to all through the priest, and one of them is the prohibition not to anoint oneself in the open air. For the Romans used to be very suspicious of rubbing down with oil, and even to-day they believe that nothing has been so much to blame for the enslavement and effeminacy of the Greeks as their gymnasia and wrestling-schools, which engender much listless idleness and waste of time in their cities, as well as paederasty and the ruin of the bodies of the young men with regulated sleeping, walking, rhythmical movements, and strict diet; by these practices they have unconsciously lapsed from the practice of arms, and have become content to be termed nimble athletes and handsome wrestlers rather than excellent men-at-arms and horsemen. It is hard work, at any rate, when men strip in the open air, to escape these consequences; but those who anoint themselves and care for their bodies in their own houses commit no offence.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why did their ancient coinage have stamped on one side a double-faced likeness of Janus, on the other the stern or the prow of a ship?<a id="ref-41-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a></h3>
<p>Is it, as many affirm, in honour of Saturn who crossed over to Italy in a ship?</p>
<p>Or, since this might be said of many, inasmuch as Janus, Evander, and Aeneas all landed in Italy after a voyage by sea, one might rather conjecture thus: some things are excellent for States, others are necessary; and of the excellent things good government is the chief, and of the necessary things facility of provision. Since, therefore, Janus established for them an ordered government by civilizing their life, and since the river, which was navigable and permitted transportation both from the sea and from the land, provided them with an abundance of necessities, the coinage came to have as its symbol the twofold form of the lawgiver, as has been stated,<a id="ref-41-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> because of the change he wrought, and the vessel as symbol of the river.</p>
<p>They also used another kind of coinage, stamped with the figures of a bull, a ram, and a boar,<a id="ref-41-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> because their prosperity came mostly from their live stock, and from these they also derived their affluence.</p>
<p>This is the reason why many of the names of the ancient families are such as the Suillii, Bubulci, Porcii,<a id="ref-41-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> as Fenestella<a id="ref-41-e" role="doc-noteref">e</a> has stated.</p>

<blockquote>Here with sickle in hand was wrought the form of rough Cronus<br>
Maiming his sire at his side, who is Uranus, offspring of Acmon.</blockquote>
Now abundant harvests and their disposal are what give rise to a monetary system; therefore they make the god who is the cause of their good fortune its guardian also. Testimony to support this may be found in the fact that the markets held every eight days and called nundinae<a id="ref-42-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> are considered sacred to Saturn, for it was the superabundance of the harvest that initiated buying and selling.</p>
<p>Or is this a matter of ancient history, and was Valerius Publicola the first to make the temple of Saturn the treasury, when the kings had been overthrown, because he believed that the place was well-protected, in plain sight, and hard to attack secretly?</p>

<p>Or is this too, like many other Latin words, a Greek word, and does it signify the supervising and guardian goddess? Hence her temple was continually open since she neither slumbers nor sleeps.</p>
<p>If, however, Labeo be right in pointing out that Hora is derived from <ruby lang="la" translate="no">parorman <rtc lang="en">to urge on</ruby><a id="ref-46-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a>, consider whether we must not declare that orator is thus to be derived, since an orator is a counsellor or popular leader who stimulates, as it were, and incites; and it is not to be derived from <ruby lang="en">"imprecating" or "praying" <rtc lang="la" translate="no">orare</ruby>, as some assert.</p>

<p>Is it because the man who has taken a wife and then lost her is more unfortunate than one who has never taken a wife? For the house of the married man is complete, but the house of him who has married and later lost his wife is not only incomplete, but also crippled.</p>
<p>Or is it because the wife assists her husband in the rites, so that many of them cannot be performed without the wife's presence, and for a man who has lost his wife to marry again immediately is neither possible perhaps nor otherwise seemly? Wherefore it was formerly illegal for the <i lang="la" translate="no">flamen</i> to divorce his wife; and it is still, as it seems, illegal, but in my day Domitian once permitted it on petition. The priests were present at that ceremony of divorce and performed many horrible, strange, and gloomy rites.<a id="ref-50-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a></p>
<p>One might be less surprised at this resignation of the <i lang="la" translate="no">flamen</i> if one should adduce also the fact that when one of the censors died, the other was obliged to resign his office<a id="ref-50-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a>; but when the censor Livius Drusus died, his colleague Aemilius Scaurus was unwilling to give up his office until certain tribunes ordered him to be led away to prison.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why do they sacrifice a female dog to the goddess called Geneta Mana<a id="ref-52-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a> and pray that none of the household shall become "good"?</h3>
<p>Is it because Geneta is a spirit concerned with the generation and birth of beings that perish? Her name means some such thing as "flux and birth" or "flowing birth."<a id="ref-52-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> Accordingly, just as the Greeks sacrifice a female dog to Hecatê,<a id="ref-52-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> even so do the Romans offer the same sacrifice to Geneta on behalf of the members of their household. But Socrates<a id="ref-52-d" role="doc-noteref">d</a> says that the Argives sacrifice a female dog to Eilioneia by reason of the ease with which the female dog brings forth its young. But does the import of the prayer, that none of them shall become "good," refer not to the human members of a household, but to the dogs? For dogs should be savage and terrifying.</p>
<p>Or, because of the fact that the dead are gracefully called "the good," are they in veiled language asking in their prayer that none of their household may die? One should not be surprised at this; Aristotle<a id="ref-52-e" role="doc-noteref">e</a> in fact, says that there is written in the treaty of the Arcadians with the Spartans: "No one shall be made good<a id="ref-52-f" role="doc-noteref">f</a> for rendering aid to the Spartan party in Tegea"; that is, no one shall be put to death.</p>

<p>Is it because the Etruscans called Veians fought against Romulus for a long time, and he took this city last of all<a id="ref-53-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a> and sold at auction many captives together with their king, taunting him for his stupidity and folly?

<p>Or must this problem also be solved by history?

<h3 itemprop="name">Why is it that on the Ides of January the flute-players are allowed to walk about the city wearing the raiment of women<a id="ref-55-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a>?</h3>
<p>Is it for the reason commonly alleged? They used to enjoy, as it seems, great honours, which King Numa had given them by reason of his piety towards the gods. Because they were later deprived of these honours by the decemviri, who were invested with consular power,<a id="ref-55-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> they withdrew from the city. There was, accordingly, inquiry made for them, and a certain superstitious fear seized upon the priests when they sacrificed without flutes. But when the flute-players would not hearken to those sent to summon them to return, but remained in Tibur, a freedman secretly promised the officials to bring them back. On the pretext of having sacrificed to the gods, he prepared a sumptuous banquet and invited the flute-players. Women were present, as well as wine, and a party lasting all the night was being celebrated with merriment and dancing, when suddenly the freedman interrupted, saying that his patron was coming to see him, and, in his perturbation, he persuaded the flute-players to climb into wagons, which were screened round about with skins, to be conveyed back to Tibur. But this was a trick, for he turned the wagons around, and, without being detected, since the flute-players comprehended nothing because of the wine and the darkness, at dawn he had brought them all to Rome. Now the majority of them happened to be clad in raiment of feminine finery because of the nocturnal drinking-bout; when, therefore, they had been persuaded and reconciled by the officials, it became their custom on that day to strut through the city clad in this manner.</p>

<h3 itemprop="name">Why are the matrons supposed to have founded the temple of Carmenta originally, and why do they reverence it now above all others?</h3>
<p>There is a certain tale repeated that the women were prevented by the senate from using horse-drawn vehicles<a id="ref-56-a" role="doc-noteref">a</a>; they therefore made an agreement with one another not to conceive nor to bear children, and they kept their husbands at a distance, until the husbands changed their minds and made the concession to them.

<p>Some assert that Carmenta was the mother of Evander and that she came to Italy; that her name was Themis, or, as others say, Nicostratê; and that because she chanted oracles in verse, she was named Carmenta by the Latins, for they call verses <i lang="la" translate="no">carmina</i>.</p>
<p>But others think that Carmenta is a Fate, and that this is the reason why the matrons sacrifice to her. The true meaning of the name is "deprived of sense,"<a id="ref-56-b" role="doc-noteref">b</a> by reason of her divine transports. Wherefore Carmenta was not so named from <i lang="la" translate="no">carmina</i>, but rather <i lang="la" translate="no">carmina</i> from her, because, in her divine frenzy, she chanted oracles in verse and metre.<a id="ref-56-c" role="doc-noteref">c</a></p>
