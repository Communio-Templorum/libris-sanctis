<h3>On Dealing with Others</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A war between the Gods is coming,</li>
	<li>But it is not our place, mere mortals, to participate in the wars for heavens.</li>
	<li>Be good to your fellow man and woman.</li>
	<li>Forget not the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you want others to do unto you.</li>
	<li>Forget the fallacy, the narcissistic view, to do unto others as they have done unto you!</li>
	<li>Forgive wrongs done to you.</li>
	<li>Think of others' life circumstances.</li>
	<li>Put yourself in their shoes.</li>
	<li>Think before you act.</li>
	<li>Think of what may have brought them to this point in their life.</li>
	<li>Stop and reflect on your own life and your own actions.</li>
	<li>Think of what thoughts have led you to your current state of emotions and actions.</li>
	<li>Never stop reflecting on your own thoughts and actions.</li>
	<li>Think about others around you.</li>
	<li>Forget not that you are always part of a group, of society.</li>
	<li>When you reflect on your thoughts and others' actions that led to your own actions, think about how you can stop and improve yourself, to change your actions and reactions in the future.</li>
	<li>When someone has wronged you, think about what may have led them to their mistaken actions and remember that it likely was not meant as a spite to you.</li>
	<li>But even if another has intended to spite you, to hurt you, you cannot give in to anger, to hatred, to disgust.</li>
	<li>Even if another has intended to hurt you, you cannot hurt them back.</li>
	<li>Even Jesus had commanded of his followers: if anyone slaps you on the cheeck, turn to him the other also.</li>
	<li>Do not give in to anger nor seek revenge.</li>
	<li>To live a long, peaceful life is the best revenge you can give.</li>

<h3>On Orthodoxy</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The Old Religion of Rome followed the dictum of <ruby lang="la">do ut des<rt lang="en">I give that you might give</rt></ruby>, a reduction of religion to a mere contractual, business-like arrangement.</li>
	<li>But forget not the words of Numa Pompilius: The Gods help those who help themselves.</li>
	<li>Amongst the Christians today we hear dictates for orthodoxy, to adhere to the faith, but too many "ministers" and "good Christians" today are not mere hypocrites professing beliefs they do not hold, they are dangrous dissemblers proudly proclaiming faith as a means to conceal their true selfish agenda.</li>
	<li>The Old Religion of Rome was very syncretic, accepting of the beliefs and Gods of other peoples and religions. I have no doubt this led to the continuous, rapid evolution of the religion and its practices throughout the history of the Republic and Empire until its final submission to the Christian God by Constantine.</li>
	<li>Though we need to proselytize to grow and challenge the Christian faith, we also need some degree of exclusivism to protect our religion and faith from hostile outside forces.</li>

<h3>On Asking the Gods for Help</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The Old Religion of Rome followed the dictum of <ruby lang="la">do ut des<rt lang="en">I give that you might give</rt></ruby>, a reduction of religion to a mere contractual, business-like arrangement.</li>
	<li>But forget not the words of Numa Pompilius: The Gods help those who help themselves.</li>
	<li>The Temples and shrines and priests cannot exploit the sorrow and desperation of the needy and destitute.</li>
	<li>No one can exploit the sorrow and desperation of the needy and destitute.</li>
	<li>The Gods help those who help themselves and the Temples and shrines and priests must too help others gain their reward.</li>
	<li>When a priest sees a person in poverty, the priest must help them with the guidance of the Gods to be able to help themselves.</li>
	<li>When a priest sees a person in need of work, the Gods command the priest to help them find work or learn new skills.</li>
	<li>When a person in poverty comes to a priest to ask for help, the Gods command the priest to help him stand on his own feet.</li>
	<li>When a person without a home asks for shelter, the Temple cannot turn him away and must help him find work and a home for himself.</li>
	<li>When a person asks a true follower of the Gods for help, the Gods command you to offer help, point them to a place for shelter, point them to a place of education, point them to the ways of the Gods, point them to the Temples of the Gods.</li>

<h3>On Working with the Gods</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The Old Religion of Rome followed the dictum of <ruby lang="la">do ut des <rt lang="en">I give that you might give</rt></ruby>.</li>
	<li>But do not reduce religion to a mere contractual, business-like arrangement.</li>
	<li>The Gods reward those who help their Temples, but giving to the Temples alone will not earn the favor of the Gods.</li>
	<li>The Gods help those who help themselves.</li>
	<li>If you wish for material prosperity, you must go out to work and find opportunities.</li>
	<li>If you wish for family, you must go out to find your mate and work to keep your relationship strong and healthy.</li>
	<li>When you give to the Gods and to the Temples, you ask for their guidance and assistance.</li>
	<li>When you give to the Gods and to the Temples, you do not pass all responsibility unto Them.</li>
	<li>Yes, you give that the Gods may give in return, but they cannot do for you.</li>
	<li>Do for yourself.</li>
	<li>The Gods do not work for you.</li>
	<li>You must work for yourself to accomplish your goals.</li>
	<li>The Gods will help you when you lift your share of the burden.</li>
