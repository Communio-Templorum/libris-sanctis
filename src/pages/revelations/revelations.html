<h2>Revelations</h2>

<section>
<ol>
	<li>A war between the Gods is coming,</li>
	<li>But it is not our place, mere mortals, to participate in the wars for heavens.</li>
	<li>Be good to your fellow man and woman.</li>
	<li>Forget not the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you want others to do unto you.</li>
	<li>Forget the fallacy, the narcissistic view, to do unto others as they have done unto you!</li>
	<li>Forgive wrongs done to you.</li>
	<li>Think of others' life circumstances.</li>
	<li>Put yourself in their shoes.</li>
	<li>Think before you act.</li>
	<li>Think of what may have brought them to this point in their life.</li>
	<li>Stop and reflect on your own life and your own actions.</li>
	<li>Think of what thoughts have led you to your current state of emotions and actions.</li>
	<li>Never stop reflecting on your own thoughts and actions.</li>
	<li>Think about others around you.</li>
	<li>Forget not that you are always part of a group, of society.</li>
	<li>When you reflect on your thoughts and others' actions that led to your own actions, think about how you can stop and improve yourself, to change your actions and reactions in the future.</li>
	<li>When someone has wronged you, think about what may have led them to their mistaken actions and remember that it likely was not meant as a spite to you.</li>
	<li>But even if another has intended to spite you, to hurt you, you cannot give in to anger, to hatred, to disgust.</li>
	<li>Even if another has intended to hurt you, you cannot hurt them back.</li>
	<li>Even Jesus had commanded of his followers: if anyone slaps you on the cheeck, turn to him the other also.</li>
	<li>Do not give in to anger nor seek revenge.</li>
	<li>To live a long, peaceful life is the best revenge you can give.</li>
